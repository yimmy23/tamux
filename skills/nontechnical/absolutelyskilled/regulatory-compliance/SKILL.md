## Key principles

1. **Compliance is continuous, not a project** - Passing an audit is a snapshot in
   time. The goal is a living program with controls that operate daily. Scrambling
   for evidence two weeks before an audit means your controls are theater, not real.

2. **Automate evidence collection** - Manual evidence collection does not scale and
   creates audit fatigue. Instrument your systems to produce compliance artifacts
   automatically: access logs, change records, configuration exports, and training
   completions should all be captured without human intervention.

3. **Controls should serve the business** - A control that creates so much friction
   that engineers route around it is worse than no control. Design controls that are
   least-privilege without being obstructive. If teams hate a control, find a more
   elegant implementation, not an exception.

4. **Start with the framework that customers demand** - Do not attempt all three
   frameworks simultaneously. Survey your enterprise customers and prospects. SOC 2
   unblocks most B2B SaaS deals. HIPAA is required the moment you touch protected
   health information. PCI-DSS is mandatory if you store, process, or transmit
   cardholder data. Pick one, reach Type II, then expand.

5. **Gap analysis before implementation** - Never start writing policies or deploying
   tools without first mapping your current state to the required controls. A gap
   analysis reveals which controls are already satisfied (often 30-40%), which need
   tooling, and which need process changes. Skipping it wastes months building
   things you already have.

## Core concepts

### Control frameworks

A control framework is a structured set of requirements that an organization must
satisfy to meet a compliance standard. The three major frameworks covered here:

| Framework | Owner | Core focus | Audit type | Who needs it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SOC 2 | AICPA | Trust Services Criteria (security, availability, confidentiality, privacy, processing integrity) | Third-party CPA audit | B2B SaaS, cloud services |
| HIPAA | U.S. HHS | Protected health information (PHI) privacy and security | Self-attestation + OCR enforcement | Healthcare, covered entities, business associates |
| PCI-DSS | PCI Security Standards Council | Cardholder data environment (CDE) protection | QSA audit (Level 1) or SAQ (Level 2-4) | Any entity storing/processing/transmitting card data |

### Evidence types

Auditors require evidence that controls are designed correctly (Type I) and operating
effectively over time (Type II). Evidence categories:

- **Configuration exports** - Screenshots or exports showing system settings (MFA
  enabled, encryption at rest, logging enabled)
- **Access reviews** - Periodic exports showing who has access to what, reviewed and
  signed off by a manager
- **Policy documents** - Written policies with version history and employee
  acknowledgment records
- **Training records** - Completion logs for security awareness and role-specific training
- **Incident records** - Log of security incidents with detection, response, and closure
- **Vendor reviews** - SOC 2 reports or security questionnaires for third-party vendors
- **Change management records** - Git history, PR approvals, deploy logs showing
  change control processes

### Audit process

```
Gap Analysis -> Remediation -> Readiness Review -> Audit -> Report
     |               |               |                |         |
  4-8 weeks      3-12 months     4-6 weeks        4-8 weeks  2-4 weeks
  Map controls   Build controls  Mock audit       Evidence   Final report
  to current     that are        with auditor     collection issued
  state          missing         (optional)
```

Type I audit: point-in-time snapshot that controls are designed appropriately.
Type II audit: 6-12 month observation period proving controls operate continuously.
Always target Type II - enterprise procurement teams reject Type I as insufficient.

### Risk assessment

Risk assessment is the foundation of every compliance framework. It identifies threats
to your systems and data, evaluates their likelihood and impact, and drives the
prioritization of controls.

**Risk score formula:** Risk = Likelihood (1-5) x Impact (1-5)

| Score | Action |
|---|---|
| 20-25 | Critical - immediate remediation required |
| 12-19 | High - remediate within 30 days |
| 6-11 | Medium - remediate within 90 days |
| 1-5 | Low - accept with documented rationale or remediate in backlog |

## Common tasks

### Prepare for SOC 2 Type II

A realistic 12-18 month roadmap for a startup with no prior compliance program:

**Months 1-2: Gap analysis and scoping**
- Define the system boundary (what systems are in scope)
- Map all Trust Services Criteria to existing controls
- Identify gaps and assign remediation owners
- Select a compliance platform (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, or manual)

**Months 3-8: Remediation**
- Implement missing technical controls (MFA everywhere, encryption at rest and in
  transit, logging and monitoring, vulnerability scanning, access reviews)
- Write required policies (security, access control, incident response, business
  continuity, vendor management, change management)
- Run employee security awareness training and document completion
- Conduct vendor reviews for all subprocessors handling customer data

**Months 9-10: Observation period start**
- All controls must be operating; the clock starts for the Type II period
- Automate evidence collection for operating controls
- Schedule quarterly access reviews and vulnerability scans

**Months 11-12: Readiness and audit**
- Conduct internal readiness review; fix any findings
- Engage auditor for fieldwork
- Respond to auditor requests within agreed SLAs
- Receive SOC 2 Type II report (6-month or 12-month observation period)

> Choose the 6-month observation period for your first report. You can expand to
> 12-month on renewal. A 6-month report unblocks deals faster.

### Implement HIPAA safeguards

HIPAA requires three categories of safeguards for covered entities and business
associates handling PHI:

**Administrative safeguards (45 CFR 164.308)**
- Conduct and document a security risk analysis annually
- Designate a Security Officer responsible for HIPAA compliance
- Implement workforce training with documented completion records
- Establish sanction policies for employees who violate HIPAA
- Define access authorization and management procedures

**Physical safeguards (45 CFR 164.310)**
- Control physical access to systems that contain PHI
- Implement workstation use and security policies
- Establish device and media controls (encryption, disposal procedures)

**Technical safeguards (45 CFR 164.312)**
- Unique user identification for all PHI access (no shared accounts)
- Automatic logoff after period of inactivity
- Encryption and decryption of PHI at rest and in transit
- Audit controls: hardware, software, and procedural mechanisms to log access to PHI
- Integrity controls: detect unauthorized PHI alteration or destruction
- Transmission security: TLS 1.2+ for all PHI in transit

**Minimum Necessary standard** - Access to PHI must be limited to the minimum
necessary to perform a job function. Implement RBAC and log all PHI access.

### Achieve PCI-DSS compliance

PCI-DSS v4.0 has 12 requirements organized around the cardholder data environment:

| Requirement | Focus | Key controls |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Network security | Segmented CDE network, firewall rules, no defaults |
| 3-4 | Data protection | Do not store SAD; encrypt PAN at rest and in transit |
| 5-6 | Vulnerability management | Anti-malware, secure development, patching SLA |
| 7-8 | Access control | Need-to-know access, MFA for CDE access, unique IDs |
| 9 | Physical security | Physical access controls for CDE hardware |
| 10-11 | Monitoring and testing | Log all CDE access, quarterly scans, annual pen test |
| 12 | Policy | Security policy, incident response plan, vendor management |

**The best PCI-DSS strategy is reducing scope.** Use a PCI-compliant payment
processor (Stripe, Braintree) with iframe/redirect tokenization. If cardholder
data never touches your servers, you qualify for SAQ A (the simplest self-assessment
questionnaire) rather than a full QSA audit.

### Conduct a risk assessment

Follow NIST SP 800-30 or ISO 27005 for a defensible methodology:

1. **Identify assets** - List all systems, data stores, and third-party services
   that store or process regulated data
2. **Identify threats** - For each asset, enumerate threat actors (external attacker,
   malicious insider, accidental disclosure) and threat events (data breach, ransomware,
   misconfiguration)
3. **Identify vulnerabilities** - What weaknesses could a threat exploit? (Unpatched
   software, weak passwords, no MFA, overly broad access)
4. **Calculate risk** - Likelihood x Impact for each threat/vulnerability pair
5. **Identify controls** - Existing controls that reduce likelihood or impact; proposed
   controls for unacceptable residual risk
6. **Document and accept** - Risk owner signs off on residual risk. Risk register is
   reviewed annually and after significant changes

### Build a controls matrix

A controls matrix maps each framework requirement to:
- The control (what you do)
- The control owner (who is responsible)
- The evidence type (what proves it)
- The evidence location (where to find it)
- The review frequency (how often it is checked)

See `references/controls-matrix.md` for a complete SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria
controls matrix you can adapt.

### Automate compliance monitoring

Manual compliance creates point-in-time snapshots that drift. Automate:

| Evidence type | Automation approach |
|---|---|
| MFA enrollment | Query IdP API (Okta, Google Workspace) on schedule; alert on non-enrolled users |
| Access reviews | Export IAM group memberships quarterly; route to manager for sign-off via workflow |
| Vulnerability scans | Run Trivy or Snyk in CI; export results to compliance platform |
| Patch status | Query endpoint management API (Jamf, Intune); flag overdue patches |
| Security training | Pull completion data from training platform API |
| Change management | Git PR merge log automatically satisfies change control evidence |
| Logging enabled | IaC enforces CloudTrail/audit logging; drift detected by policy-as-code |

Compliance platforms like Vanta, Drata, and Secureframe automate most of this via
integrations. Evaluate whether the platform cost (typically $15k-$40k/year) is
justified by the hours saved vs. manual evidence collection.

### Manage the audit process

A well-run audit avoids surprises. Follow this timeline:

**T-8 weeks: Auditor kickoff**
- Agree on scope, observation period dates, and fieldwork schedule
- Share the controls matrix and request the evidence request list (PBC list)
- Assign an internal point of contact for auditor questions

**T-4 weeks: Evidence preparation**
- Collect all requested evidence; organize by control number
- Review for gaps or anomalies before submission
- Do not submit evidence you have not reviewed

**T-2 weeks: Fieldwork**
- Respond to auditor questions within 24-48 hours
- Track open items in a shared log
- Escalate blockers immediately - do not let items age

**T-0: Report delivery**
- Review draft report carefully for factual errors before it is finalized
- Exceptions (qualified opinions) are negotiable if the evidence was misunderstood
- Attach a management response to any exceptions explaining remediation plans

> An exception in a SOC 2 report is not automatically a deal-breaker. Customers
> read the management response. A clear remediation timeline with evidence of
> progress is often acceptable.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Treating compliance as a one-time project | Controls decay, evidence gaps appear, audit fails or findings increase year-over-year | Build a continuous program with automated evidence and quarterly reviews |
| Scope creep - putting everything in scope | Larger scope = more controls = more cost and audit time | Define the tightest defensible scope; use network segmentation to exclude non-regulated systems |
| Writing policies nobody reads or follows | Policies without enforcement are paper compliance that auditors see through | Tie every policy to a technical control or an automated check; require annual acknowledgment |
| Buying a compliance platform before a gap analysis | Platform integrations cover generic controls; custom controls still need manual work | Complete the gap analysis first; then evaluate platforms against your specific control gaps |
| Using shared accounts to access regulated systems | Violates individual accountability requirements in every major framework | Enforce unique user IDs at the IdP level; fail pipelines that use shared credentials |
| Deferring the risk assessment until the last month | Risk assessment drives control selection; doing it late means controls may not address real risks | Complete risk assessment in the first gap analysis phase; repeat annually |

## Gotchas

1. **Starting SOC 2 Type II observation period before all controls operate** - The observation clock starts when controls are running, not when you decide to pursue SOC 2. Auditors verify operating effectiveness over the claimed period. Any control that was not operating at the start of the period creates a gap finding. Don't declare the observation period started until every control is actually in place.

2. **PCI-DSS scope assumed to be narrow before scoping exercise** - Teams often assume they're out of scope because they "don't store card numbers." But processing or transmitting card data, or being on the same network segment as systems that do, puts you in scope. Conduct formal scope definition with a QSA before building any compliance program assumptions.

3. **Compliance platform purchased before gap analysis** - Vanta and Drata automate evidence for generic controls but cannot replace custom controls specific to your architecture. Buying the platform before knowing your gaps means paying for integrations that don't cover your actual exposures.

4. **Exception in SOC 2 report treated as a deal-breaker** - A qualified opinion with a management response showing a clear remediation plan is often acceptable to enterprise procurement. The response matters as much as the exception. Draft the management response carefully and include a concrete timeline with evidence of progress.

5. **Risk assessment done once and never updated** - A static risk assessment taken at the start of a compliance program becomes fiction within 6 months as systems change. Schedule annual reviews and trigger an unscheduled review after any significant architecture change, acquisition, or data classification change.
