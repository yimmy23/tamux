# Customer Support Operations

Customer support operations covers the full support lifecycle - from triage and
routing through SLA tracking, escalation, and resolution - plus the operational
layer of macros, queue management, VIP handling, and on-call rotations. This skill
provides actionable frameworks for each layer: priority matrices, SLA structures
by tier and priority, macro libraries, escalation paths, and queue optimization.
Built for support leaders moving from reactive firefighting to a measurable,
repeatable support machine.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Needs to design or improve a ticket triage system or priority matrix
- Wants to define or audit SLAs by customer tier or ticket priority
- Is building or standardizing a macro and response template library
- Needs to design or document escalation workflows and trigger conditions
- Wants to optimize queue management or reduce queue aging
- Is setting up VIP or enterprise support lanes
- Needs to design a support on-call or follow-the-sun rotation
- Is measuring or improving first response time or resolution time

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Production incident management or war room coordination (use incident-management skill)
- Writing individual customer replies without a process context (use a writing assistant skill)

---

## Key principles

1. **First response time is king** - The metric customers feel most is how quickly
   someone acknowledges their problem. A fast FRT buys goodwill and time. Every SLA
   must prioritize FRT above all others. Measure it first; everything else is secondary.

2. **Triage before solving** - An untriaged queue is a random queue. Agents working in
   random order guarantee high-priority problems wait behind low-priority ones. Triage
   assigns priority, tier, and routing - it does not solve the problem.

3. **Macros save hours, not minutes** - One macro used 50 times a day saves 50x the
   time invested in writing it. Expand the library whenever agents write the same reply
   more than once a week. Review quarterly. A bad macro is worse than no macro.

4. **Escalation paths must be clear** - Ambiguous escalation is the leading cause of
   tickets stalling. Every agent must know, without asking, exactly when and where to
   escalate. If an agent has to think about whether to escalate, the path is not clear.

5. **Measure everything** - Support intuition degrades under volume. Track FRT,
   resolution time, CSAT, first contact resolution rate, escalation rate, and queue age.
   Review weekly. Data surfaces problems before customers do.

## Core concepts

### Support tiers

| Tier | Typical customers | Support entitlement |
|---|---|---|
| Community / Free | Trial, free plan | Docs and community forum only |
| Standard | Paying customers | Email, SLA 24h FRT |
| Professional | Growth plan | Email + chat, SLA 8h FRT |
| Enterprise | Large contracts | All channels, SLA 1h FRT, named contacts |

**Tier assignment rule:** Tier is set at account creation from the billing plan and
must trigger automatic re-routing in the ticketing system. Never rely on agents to
manually route by tier - automate it.

### SLA components

| Component | Definition | Measured from |
|---|---|---|
| First Response Time (FRT) | Time from ticket creation to first agent reply | Ticket creation |
| Next Response Time (NRT) | Time between agent replies after customer responds | Customer reply |
| Resolution Time (RT) | Time from ticket creation to closed status | Ticket creation |

**SLA clock rules:**
- FRT clock starts immediately on ticket creation, including nights and weekends,
  unless the tier contract specifies business hours only.
- Clock pauses when a ticket enters "Pending Customer" status (waiting on customer).
- Clock never pauses for internal notes or transfers between agents.

### Ticket lifecycle

```
Submitted -> Triaged -> Assigned -> In Progress -> Pending Customer
                                        |                  |
                                    Escalated          Reopened
                                        |
                                    Resolved -> Closed (auto after 7 days)
```

Each transition must have a defined owner and time constraint. Tickets sitting in
"Triaged" for more than 30 minutes indicate a routing or staffing problem. Tickets
in "In Progress" beyond the resolution SLA need a manager flag.

### Queue management

**Queue states to monitor:**

| State | Definition | Action threshold |
|---|---|---|
| New | Submitted, not yet triaged | > 15 min: trigger triage alert |
| Breached | Past FRT SLA | Escalate to lead immediately |
| At-risk | Within 20% of SLA window | Flag for prioritization |
| Aging | Open > 5 days with no update | Manager review required |
| Stalled | No agent activity > 24 hours | Auto-assign to queue lead |

## Common tasks

### Design a triage system

**Priority matrix (impact x urgency):**

| | Low urgency | High urgency |
|---|---|---|
| **High impact** | P2 - schedule soon | P1 - respond now |
| **Low impact** | P4 - backlog | P3 - respond today |

**Priority definitions:**

```
P1 - Critical:  Service down, data loss, security issue, or revenue blocked.
                FRT target: 1 hour. Assign immediately. Page on-call if needed.

P2 - High:      Core feature broken, workaround difficult, or VIP affected.
                FRT target: 4 hours. Pull from queue before P3/P4.

P3 - Normal:    Feature degraded, workaround exists, standard customer.
                FRT target: per tier SLA (8h or 24h).

P4 - Low:       Cosmetic issue, how-to question, feature request.
                FRT target: 48 hours. May be batch-processed.
```

**Triage checklist (run on every new ticket):**
1. Assign priority using the matrix above.
2. Confirm customer tier from CRM. Upgrade priority if enterprise.
3. Check for duplicate tickets from the same account - merge if found.
4. Apply tags: product area, issue type, channel source.
5. Route to the correct queue or agent group.
6. Set SLA clock based on tier and priority.

### Set up SLAs

**SLA matrix by tier and priority:**

| Tier | P1 FRT | P2 FRT | P3 FRT | P4 FRT | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Community | 72h | 72h | 72h | 72h | Best effort |
| Standard | 8h | 24h | 24h | 48h | 5 business days |
| Professional | 4h | 8h | 8h | 24h | 3 business days |
| Enterprise | 1h | 4h | 8h | 24h | 1-2 business days |

**SLA escalation rules:**
- At 75% of FRT window: auto-flag the ticket as "at-risk" in the queue view.
- At 100% of FRT window: alert the team lead via Slack and mark as breached.
- At 150% of FRT window: escalate to support manager, log as SLA violation.

**Weekly SLA health report:** FRT compliance % per tier (target > 95%), resolution
compliance % per tier (target > 90%), breach count by priority, top 5 breach reasons.

### Create a macro and template library

**Macro taxonomy:**

```
Acknowledgment:
  - First response: issue received
  - First response: investigating
  - First response: needs more info

Status Updates:
  - Update: investigating root cause
  - Update: fix in progress, ETA known
  - Update: fix in progress, ETA unknown
  - Update: escalated to engineering

Resolution:
  - Resolution: issue fixed, steps to verify
  - Resolution: workaround provided
  - Resolution: known issue, linked to status page

Closures:
  - Closing: no response from customer (7 days)
  - Closing: duplicate ticket
  - Closing: feature request logged

VIP and Escalations:
  - VIP: acknowledgment with named CSM
  - Escalation received: enterprise path
```

**Macro quality rules:**
- Every macro must have a human-review checkpoint. Never send blind.
- Macros must include placeholder fields for: customer name, product area,
  ticket number, and agent name.
- Review and update the full library every quarter.
- Retire macros with a < 2% usage rate after 90 days.

See `references/macro-templates.md` for the full ready-to-use template library.

### Build escalation workflows

**Escalation paths:**

```
Tier 1 (Front-line) -> Tier 2 (Technical Support) -> Engineering
       |                         |                        |
   General issues           Complex bugs             Code-level bugs,
   How-to questions         Integrations             data issues,
   Account issues           Advanced config          security incidents
```

**Escalation triggers (agent must escalate when):**

| Condition | Escalate to | SLA for response |
|---|---|---|
| No resolution after 2 agent replies | Tier 2 | 2 hours |
| Customer reports data loss or corruption | Engineering direct | 30 minutes |
| Security vulnerability mentioned | Security team | Immediate |
| Enterprise customer unresolved > 4h | CSM + Support Lead | 1 hour |
| Customer requests to speak to management | Support Lead | 2 hours |
| Same issue reported by 3+ accounts in 24h | Incident channel | Immediate |

**Escalation handoff requirements - every escalation must include:**
1. Summary of the issue in 2-3 sentences.
2. Steps already tried and their outcomes.
3. Customer tier and sentiment (calm / frustrated / at churn risk).
4. Relevant screenshots, logs, or error messages attached.
5. Proposed priority for the receiving team.

### Optimize queue management

**Queue health metrics:**

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg queue age (open tickets) | < 24h | 24-48h | > 48h |
| % tickets at-risk | < 5% | 5-15% | > 15% |
| % tickets breached | < 2% | 2-5% | > 5% |
| First contact resolution rate | > 70% | 60-70% | < 60% |
| Ticket reopen rate | < 10% | 10-20% | > 20% |

**Queue optimization tactics:**
- **Morning triage burst:** First 30 minutes of each shift: triage all new tickets before agents pick up personal queues.
- **Aging sweep:** Every 4 hours, a lead scans for tickets with no activity in 24h and reassigns or prompts.
- **Tag-based batching:** Group similar tickets and batch-reply after one root-cause investigation.
- **Deflection loop:** Top 10 ticket topics each week. 5+ recurrences means a help article is needed.

### Handle VIP and enterprise support

**VIP designation criteria:**
- Contract value above a defined threshold (e.g., > $50k ARR).
- Named in the contract as a "premium support" account.
- Manually flagged by Sales or CS at deal close.

**VIP support protocol:**

| Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| Creation | Auto-tag VIP, route to dedicated queue, notify CSM via Slack, send VIP macro within 15 min |
| Resolution | Proactive updates every 4h, CC CSM on all replies, escalations go direct to senior agent |
| Closure | CSM personal follow-up within 24h, suppress CSAT if relationship is sensitive, log in CRM |

### Design an on-call support rotation

**Rotation structure:**

```
Primary on-call:    Monitors queue, handles escalations, pages engineering if needed.
Secondary on-call:  Available for overflow; backup if primary is unavailable.
Support lead:       Available for management escalations and SLA breach approvals.
```

**Follow-the-sun model (distributed teams):**

| Region | Coverage (UTC) | Handoff |
|---|---|---|
| APAC | 00:00 - 08:00 | 08:00 UTC |
| EMEA | 08:00 - 16:00 | 16:00 UTC |
| Americas | 16:00 - 00:00 | 00:00 UTC |

**On-call health metrics:**

| Metric | Healthy | Unhealthy |
|---|---|---|
| Escalations per on-call shift | < 3 | > 8 |
| After-hours P1 tickets per week | < 2 | > 5 |
| On-call handoff notes complete | > 90% | < 70% |

**On-call rotation rules:** Minimum 4 agents per region. Never assign the same
agent two consecutive weeks. Provide compensation for after-hours coverage.
On-call agent must complete a shift handoff note before logging off.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it is wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| No triage step - agents pick from the top | High-priority tickets wait behind low-priority ones; SLAs breach for enterprise customers | Enforce a triage queue; no agent picks a ticket until it has been triaged and prioritized |
| SLAs based on business hours for enterprise | Enterprise customers expect 24x7 coverage; business-hours SLAs create surprise outages at weekends | Define SLAs in calendar hours for enterprise tiers; staff accordingly or use follow-the-sun |
| Macros sent without review | Generic replies to nuanced problems destroy CSAT; customers feel like a number | Every macro send requires agent review of all populated fields; never auto-fire macros |
| Escalation with no context | Receiving team re-investigates what front-line already knows, wasting hours | Mandate a structured 5-point handoff note on every escalation |
| Measuring only resolution time | Slow FRT loses customers even when resolution is fast; CSAT drops before resolution happens | Track and report FRT as the primary SLA metric; resolution time is secondary |
| VIP tickets in the shared queue | VIP accounts lose priority to volume; CSM discovers the problem when the customer complains | Route VIP tickets to a dedicated queue with guaranteed assignment within 15 minutes |

---

## Gotchas

1. **SLA clock running during "Pending Customer" status** - Many ticketing system configurations keep the SLA clock running even when a ticket is waiting on the customer. This inflates resolution time metrics and creates false SLA breaches. Verify your ticketing platform pauses the clock correctly when status changes to "Pending Customer" or equivalent.

2. **Macros that skip populated placeholder fields** - A macro template with `{customer_name}` that sends as-is when the field is empty sends customers an email that starts "Hi ," - a CSAT disaster. Every macro must require agent review before send; never configure auto-fire on macros with dynamic fields.

3. **Enterprise tickets routed into the shared queue** - An enterprise customer submitting a ticket via the same channel as a free-tier user will wait behind a backlog of low-priority tickets unless routing is automated. VIP/enterprise tier identification must happen at ticket creation via CRM lookup, not manual agent review.

4. **On-call rotations without minimum coverage rules** - An on-call rotation with only two engineers per region means one calling in sick leaves a single person covering P1s. Define a minimum viable coverage threshold and have a clear escalation path when it cannot be met (pool from a secondary region, use a support-on-call vendor, etc.).

5. **Escalation handoffs without context transfer** - Escalating a ticket with only "customer is unhappy" forces the Tier 2 agent to re-investigate everything already discovered. Every escalation must include: the issue summary, steps already tried with outcomes, customer tier and sentiment, and all relevant logs or screenshots. Missing any of these doubles the resolution time.
