# Video Production

Video production for YouTube and online platforms is a multi-stage craft spanning
ideation, scriptwriting, filming, editing, thumbnail design, and SEO optimization.
The difference between a video that gets 100 views and one that gets 100,000 is
rarely production quality alone - it is the combination of a compelling hook, tight
script structure, strategic editing pacing, a click-worthy thumbnail, and metadata
that the algorithm can surface. This skill gives an agent the knowledge to assist
across the entire production pipeline.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Wants to write or outline a YouTube video script
- Needs help structuring a video for maximum audience retention
- Asks about video editing workflow, pacing, or transitions
- Wants to design or critique a thumbnail concept
- Needs YouTube SEO help (titles, descriptions, tags, chapters)
- Asks about content strategy, upload scheduling, or niche selection
- Wants to improve click-through rate (CTR) or average view duration (AVD)
- Needs to repurpose long-form video into shorts or clips

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Live streaming setup or OBS/streaming software configuration
- Video hosting infrastructure, CDN architecture, or transcoding pipelines

## Key principles

1. **Hook in the first 5 seconds** - The opening determines whether someone watches
   or scrolls. State the value proposition, create curiosity, or pattern-interrupt
   immediately. Never start with an intro logo or "hey guys, welcome back."

2. **Retention is the algorithm's favorite metric** - YouTube promotes videos that
   keep people watching. Every script decision, edit cut, and visual choice should
   serve retention. If a section doesn't earn the next 30 seconds, cut it.

3. **The thumbnail is half the video** - A video nobody clicks is a video nobody
   watches. Design the thumbnail before writing the script - it forces you to
   distill the video's promise into one compelling visual moment.

4. **Pattern interrupt every 30-60 seconds** - Human attention decays predictably.
   Use B-roll, graphics, camera angle changes, music shifts, or pacing changes to
   re-engage viewers at regular intervals throughout the edit.

5. **Metadata serves discovery, not description** - Titles, descriptions, and tags
   exist to help YouTube's algorithm match your video to the right audience. Write
   for searchability and click-through, not as a content summary.

## Core concepts

The video production pipeline has four phases that feed into each other:

**Pre-production** is where most successful videos are won or lost. This includes
topic research (what does the audience want?), title/thumbnail concepting (is this
clickable?), and scriptwriting (does the structure retain?). Spending 60% of effort
here and 40% on production/post is the right ratio for most creators.

**Production** covers filming, audio capture, and lighting. For most YouTube
creators, "good enough" production quality with exceptional content beats
cinema-quality production with weak scripts. Prioritize clear audio above all
else - viewers tolerate mediocre video but abandon bad audio instantly.

**Post-production** is the editing phase where pacing, visual engagement, and
polish come together. The edit should feel invisible - cuts serve the story, not
the editor's ego. J-cuts, L-cuts, and jump cuts each have specific retention
functions. See `references/editing-workflows.md`.

**Publishing and optimization** is the final mile - thumbnail upload, title
refinement, description with keywords and chapters, end screens, and cards.
The first 48 hours after publish are critical for algorithmic evaluation.
See `references/youtube-seo.md`.

## Common tasks

### Write a YouTube video script

Use the HBES (Hook-Bridge-Body-Exit-Subscribe) framework:

- **Hook (0:00-0:30):** Open with a curiosity gap, bold claim, story entry, or
  pattern interrupt. Example: "There's a reason 90% of new channels quit after
  6 months - and it has nothing to do with equipment."
- **Bridge (0:30-1:00):** Transition from hook to body. Establish credibility, set
  expectations ("In the next 10 minutes, you'll learn X, Y, and Z").
- **Body (1:00 to end-2:00):** Deliver core content using one structure: listicle,
  step-by-step tutorial, story arc (problem-struggle-discovery-resolution), or
  comparison with a verdict. Each section follows: Claim - Evidence - Example -
  Transition.
- **Exit (last 30s):** Deliver payoff. Summarize the key takeaway in one sentence.
  End with energy, never trail off.
- **Subscribe CTA:** Weave naturally into content ("If this is helping, subscribe
  so you don't miss part 2") rather than begging at the start.

See `references/scriptwriting-frameworks.md` for advanced structures and templates.

### Design an effective thumbnail

Follow the 3-element rule - a strong thumbnail has exactly three components:

1. **Face or subject** - A human face with exaggerated emotion (surprise, concern,
   excitement) outperforms text-only by 2-3x CTR. If no face, use a striking
   subject at large scale.
2. **Text overlay** - 3-5 words maximum. Bold sans-serif fonts (Impact, Bebas Neue,
   Montserrat Black). Text adds context the image alone cannot convey.
3. **Visual contrast** - Complementary colors, bright against dark or vice versa.
   Must be legible at 160x90 pixels (mobile size).

See `references/thumbnail-design.md` for color psychology, composition, and testing.

> Avoid: cluttered backgrounds, small text, low contrast, stock photo aesthetics.

### Optimize YouTube SEO metadata

**Title:** Front-load primary keyword in first 40 characters. Add a curiosity or
benefit modifier ("How to X Without Y", "X in 2025"). Keep under 60 characters.

**Description:** First 2 lines appear above the fold - include primary keyword and
a hook. Add 200-300 words of keyword-rich context. Include timestamps/chapters.

**Tags:** 5-10 tags mixing broad and specific. First tag = exact primary keyword.
Maximum 3 hashtags (shown above title on mobile).

See `references/youtube-seo.md` for keyword research and algorithm signals.

### Structure edits for retention

Map edit pacing to the audience retention curve:

- **0:00-0:30 (Hook zone):** Fast cuts, 2-3 second shots. No filler. 30-40% of
  viewers drop here.
- **0:30-3:00 (Setup zone):** Slightly slower. Establish structure. Include a
  "mini-payoff" before 2:00 to survive the second drop-off cliff.
- **3:00-middle (Body):** Alternate 30-60 second teach segments with 5-10 second
  pattern interrupts (B-roll, graphics, angle changes).
- **Last 20% (Payoff):** Accelerate pacing. Deliver promised value. Tease next
  video for end-screen clicks.

See `references/editing-workflows.md` for cut types and software workflows.

### Create video chapters

Chapters improve SEO, user experience, and watch time. Format in description:

```
0:00 - Introduction
0:45 - Why this matters
2:10 - Step 1: Setting up the project
4:30 - Step 2: Implementing the core logic
7:15 - Step 3: Testing and debugging
9:00 - Common mistakes to avoid
10:30 - Final results and next steps
```

Rules: first timestamp must be `0:00`, minimum 3 chapters, each title should be
descriptive and keyword-aware (not "Part 1", "Part 2").

### Repurpose long-form into shorts

Extract high-retention segments for Shorts, TikTok, and Reels:

1. Identify retention peaks - segments where the graph is flat or rising
2. Reframe vertically (9:16), keep subject center-frame
3. Hook in first 1-2 seconds (not 5 like long-form)
4. Target 30-45 seconds for optimal Shorts performance
5. Add captions - 80%+ of short-form is watched without sound
6. End with a loop - last frame connects to first for replay value

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Writing scripts like blog posts | Written and spoken language have different rhythms; blog-style sounds stiff on camera | Write conversationally - read aloud while drafting, use contractions, short sentences |
| Burying the hook | Starting with context, backstory, or intros before the hook kills early retention | Open with the most compelling 10 seconds of the entire video |
| Over-editing | Excessive transitions, sound effects, and zoom cuts feel amateur and exhaust viewers | Use cuts that serve content; invisible editing is the goal |
| Clickbait without payoff | Thumbnails/titles that overpromise destroy trust and tank retention | Every promise in the thumbnail must be fulfilled in the video |
| Ignoring audio quality | Viewers forgive bad video but not bad audio; poor audio signals amateur | Invest in a decent microphone before upgrading cameras |
| Keyword stuffing metadata | Cramming unrelated keywords into titles/descriptions triggers spam detection | Use 1 primary keyword naturally in title, 2-3 related terms in description |
| Inconsistent uploads | Sporadic uploads confuse the algorithm and break subscriber habits | Pick a sustainable cadence (weekly, biweekly) and maintain it 3+ months |

## Gotchas

1. **YouTube's algorithm evaluates the first 24-48 hours heavily** - Publishing at the wrong time of day (when your audience is asleep) depresses early click-through rate, which signals low quality to the algorithm and suppresses further distribution. Analyze your audience's peak activity in YouTube Analytics and schedule publishes for 1-2 hours before that window.

2. **Thumbnail CTR on the home feed differs from search CTR** - A thumbnail optimized for search (keyword-heavy text overlay) often underperforms on the home feed where curiosity and emotion drive clicks. Test thumbnails in both contexts; your best search thumbnail may not be your best browse thumbnail.

3. **YouTube chapters only activate if the first timestamp is exactly `0:00`** - If the first chapter timestamp is `0:01` or has any formatting variation (space before the dash, colon instead of a hyphen), YouTube will not generate chapters and the description timestamps will be plain text. Validate chapter formatting exactly.

4. **Reusing a Shorts clip verbatim from long-form suppresses both videos** - YouTube detects near-duplicate content and may deprioritize the Short, the long-form, or both. Reframe Shorts by adding a unique hook, captions, or vertical-specific b-roll rather than extracting the segment unchanged.

5. **Writing a script that reads naturally is harder than writing to be read** - Scripts written in prose style sound stilted when spoken. Common failure: long dependent clauses, no paragraph breaks for breath, transitions that work visually but not aurally. Read every script aloud before recording; if you pause or stumble, rewrite that sentence.
