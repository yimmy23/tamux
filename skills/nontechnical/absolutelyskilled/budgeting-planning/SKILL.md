# Budgeting & Planning

Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) is the discipline of translating business
strategy into numbers, tracking execution against those numbers, and using the
gap between plan and actuals to drive better decisions. The goal is not to
produce a perfect budget - it is to create a shared financial language that
aligns teams, surfaces trade-offs early, and enables rapid course correction.

---

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Needs to build an annual operating budget or multi-year plan
- Wants to run variance analysis against a budget or forecast
- Is implementing or improving a rolling forecast process
- Needs to allocate shared costs across departments or cost centers
- Is planning headcount - new hires, backfill, contractors, timing
- Wants to build or improve a department-level budget
- Needs to present a budget or financial plan to leadership

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Real-time financial reporting or accounting close processes (use an accounting
  or ERP workflow instead - budgeting is forward-looking, not record-keeping)
- Investment analysis or capital allocation for M&A (use a corporate finance or
  DCF skill - those require a different valuation framework)

## Key principles

1. **Budget is a plan, not a constraint** - A budget is a hypothesis about the
   future. When reality diverges from plan, the job is to understand why and
   update the forecast - not to defend the original numbers or cut spending
   mechanically to hit a line. A budget that nobody updates is just a document.

2. **Rolling forecasts beat annual budgets** - An annual budget is stale the
   day it is published. Rolling forecasts (typically 12 or 18 months forward,
   updated monthly or quarterly) keep the financial view current with business
   reality. Many high-performing FP&A teams use the annual budget for target-
   setting and rolling forecasts for operational decision-making.

3. **Variance analysis drives learning** - The value of budgeting is not the
   budget itself but the discipline of comparing plan to actuals and asking
   "why?" Every significant variance is a signal: market changed, assumption
   was wrong, execution slipped, or an opportunity emerged. Variance analysis
   without root-cause investigation is just arithmetic.

4. **Zero-base periodically** - Incremental budgeting ("last year plus 5%")
   locks in historical inefficiencies. Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) forces every
   dollar to be justified from scratch. ZBB is expensive - do it for a full
   business unit every 3-5 years, or for cost categories that have grown faster
   than revenue for two consecutive years.

5. **Headcount is the biggest lever** - In most knowledge-work businesses,
   60-70% of operating expenses are people costs (salaries, benefits, payroll
   taxes). Headcount planning is therefore the highest-leverage FP&A activity.
   Model headcount at the individual role level, not in aggregate - aggregate
   headcount budgets hide timing assumptions and grade-mix shifts.

## Core concepts

### Budget types

| Type | Description | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Operating budget (OpEx) | Revenue, COGS, gross margin, operating expenses, EBITDA | Annual planning cycle, P&L management |
| Capital budget (CapEx) | Long-lived asset purchases: equipment, infrastructure, software licenses | Investment decisions, depreciation schedules |
| Cash flow budget | Operating + CapEx + financing cash flows | Liquidity management, runway planning |
| Zero-based budget | Every line item justified from zero each cycle | Cost discipline, restructuring periods |
| Rolling forecast | 12-18 month forward view, updated each period | Operational decision-making, investor guidance |

### Variance analysis

Variance = Actuals - Budget (favorable if positive for revenue, negative for
expenses; adverse if the opposite). Three decomposition layers:

- **Volume variance** - driven by more or fewer units/transactions than planned
- **Price/rate variance** - driven by a different price or unit cost than planned
- **Mix variance** - driven by a shift in the composition of revenue or cost

### Rolling forecasts

A rolling forecast extends the planning horizon by one period every time one
period closes. Instead of a fixed year-end target, the team always looks the
same distance into the future. Cadence options:

- **Monthly with 12-month horizon** - high effort, high accuracy, used by fast-
  growth companies where 3-month-old assumptions are obsolete
- **Quarterly with 4-6 quarter horizon** - balanced effort, used by most mid-
  market companies
- **Annual reforecast** - minimum viable; update the annual budget once (e.g.
  at mid-year) to reflect H1 actuals

### Cost centers

Cost centers are organizational units tracked for expense accountability but
not directly linked to revenue. Categorization matters for allocation:

- **Direct cost centers** - produce the product or service (engineering,
  manufacturing, customer success delivery)
- **Indirect cost centers** - support the business (HR, finance, IT, legal,
  facilities)
- **Shared services** - serve multiple business units and require allocation

## Common tasks

### Build an annual budget

Use this template sequence to construct a bottom-up operating budget:

**Step 1 - Revenue model**
```
Revenue = Volume x Price (by product / segment / channel)
- Prior year actuals as base
- Growth assumptions by segment (market data + sales pipeline + management targets)
- Pricing assumptions (list price, discount rate, mix shifts)
```

**Step 2 - COGS and gross margin**
```
COGS = Variable COGS + Fixed COGS
- Variable: unit costs x volume (hosting, payment processing, direct labor)
- Fixed: depreciation, facilities tied to delivery
Gross Margin % = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
```

**Step 3 - Operating expenses by department**
```
For each department:
  Headcount costs = (salary + benefits + payroll tax) per FTE x planned FTEs
  + Timing of new hires (partial-year cost for mid-year starts)
  Non-headcount = software, contractors, T&E, marketing spend, etc.
```

**Step 4 - EBITDA and cash flow bridge**
```
EBITDA = Gross Profit - OpEx
Cash flow = EBITDA - CapEx - working capital changes - debt service
```

**Step 5 - Scenario analysis**
```
Base case: most likely assumptions
Bear case: 10-20% below base revenue, hold costs at base
Bull case: 15-25% above base revenue, model incremental investment
```

### Conduct variance analysis

Use the FAV/UNF framework to structure every variance report:

```
For each P&L line:
  1. Compute: Actual vs. Budget ($) and (%)
  2. Flag: Favorable (FAV) or Unfavorable (UNF)
  3. Decompose (if >$X threshold or >5%):
     - Is variance volume-driven? (more/fewer units)
     - Is variance rate/price-driven? (unit cost or price changed)
     - Is it timing? (spend shifted quarters - not a real variance)
     - Is it a new item not in budget? (one-time or structural)
  4. Root cause: one sentence explaining why
  5. Reforecast impact: does this variance repeat in future months?
```

See `references/variance-templates.md` for full report formats.

### Implement rolling forecasts

**Transition from annual budgeting to rolling forecasts:**

1. Lock the current annual budget as the baseline "target" - this is what
   compensation and bonuses are measured against
2. Start a parallel 12-month rolling model updated monthly
3. In the rolling model, lock the nearest 1-2 months (actuals will replace
   them shortly); allow full flexibility in months 3-12
4. Each month: ingest actuals, roll forward by one month, update assumptions
   for months 3-12 based on what changed
5. Measure forecast accuracy: track MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
   by line item; target <5% on revenue, <8% on total OpEx

**Forecast lock dates (example cadence):**
```
Day 3 after period close: actuals loaded, prior period locked
Day 5: department heads update their forward months
Day 7: FP&A consolidates and runs sanity checks
Day 10: CFO review and final lock
```

### Plan headcount

Build the headcount model at the individual-role level:

```
For each planned role:
  - Job title and grade/level
  - Department and cost center
  - Start date (month precision)
  - Annualized base salary (use midpoint of band)
  - Benefits load % (typically 20-30% of base; confirm with HR/payroll)
  - Employer payroll taxes (6.2% FICA SS up to wage base + 1.45% Medicare)
  - Fully-loaded cost = base x (1 + benefits load + payroll tax %)
  - Budget = fully-loaded cost x (months remaining in year / 12)

Contractor model:
  - Bill rate x estimated hours (or monthly retainer)
  - No benefits load; may carry a premium vs. FTE for flexibility
```

Track four headcount metrics monthly:
- **Planned headcount** - approved budget positions
- **Filled headcount** - active employees (including notice periods)
- **Open requisitions** - approved but unfilled
- **Attrition** - voluntary and involuntary departures; factor 10-15% annual
  attrition into hiring plan to hold steady-state headcount

### Allocate costs

Choose the allocation method by cost type:

| Method | When to use | Allocation base |
|---|---|---|
| Direct | Cost is 100% attributable to one department | N/A - charge directly |
| Indirect (simple) | Shared cost, easy driver | Headcount, revenue, square footage |
| Activity-based (ABC) | High shared cost, heterogeneous usage | Actual activity units consumed |
| Tiered | Large shared service with SLA tiers | Weighted usage by tier |

**Activity-based cost allocation example:**
```
IT infrastructure cost: $1,200,000/year
Driver: compute units consumed per department (measured from cloud billing)

Engineering: 60% of compute = $720,000
Product:     15% of compute = $180,000
Sales:       10% of compute = $120,000
G&A:         15% of compute = $180,000
```

Avoid headcount-only allocation for technical shared services - it misprices
costs and subsidizes heavy users at the expense of light users.

### Build department budgets

Guide department heads through this template:

```
Department Budget Template
--------------------------
1. Mission and top priorities for the year (3-5 bullet points)
2. Headcount plan: current FTEs, planned adds, planned attrition, end-of-year
3. Headcount cost (use standard fully-loaded rates from FP&A)
4. Non-headcount detail:
   - Software/SaaS subscriptions (list each tool and annual cost)
   - Contractors and professional services
   - Travel and entertainment (T&E)
   - Training and development
   - Other (specify)
5. Total department budget
6. Key assumptions and risks
7. Investment requests above baseline (rank-ordered with ROI rationale)
```

Run budget calibration sessions: compare department requests to company-level
targets; negotiate trade-offs before the final budget is locked.

### Present budget to leadership

Structure the budget presentation deck as:

```
1. Executive summary (1 slide)
   - Revenue, gross margin, EBITDA, headcount - plan vs. prior year
   - 3 key bets the budget funds

2. Revenue plan (2-3 slides)
   - By segment / product / geography
   - Growth assumptions and confidence level
   - Pipeline coverage ratio

3. Cost structure (2-3 slides)
   - Gross margin bridge: prior year to plan
   - OpEx waterfall: headcount vs. non-headcount growth
   - Cost as % of revenue trend

4. Headcount plan (1-2 slides)
   - Net adds by department
   - Hiring timing and pipeline status

5. Scenario analysis (1 slide)
   - Bear / Base / Bull EBITDA and cash flow
   - Key sensitivities (e.g., "$5M revenue miss = $X EBITDA impact")

6. Key risks and mitigations (1 slide)

7. Asks / decisions needed (1 slide)
```

Lead with the so-what on every slide. CFOs and CEOs do not want to read tables
- they want to know what the number means for the business.

## Anti-patterns

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Incremental budgeting without review | Locks in historical spend regardless of ROI; 10% growth on wasteful spend is still waste | Zero-base any cost category that grew faster than revenue for 2+ years |
| Sandbagging revenue / padding costs | Teams build in buffers to hit targets easily; aggregated company plan is materially off | Separate "stretch targets" from "base case" - be explicit about the probability level of each |
| Monthly budget with no rolling forecast | By Q3, the annual budget is so stale it drives no decisions | Maintain a rolling 12-month forecast alongside the annual budget target |
| Headcount in aggregate | Hides timing and grade-mix; a "10 headcount" budget might mean very different things | Model every role by title, level, start month, and fully-loaded cost |
| Allocating shared costs equally by headcount | Misprices costs; a 3-person engineering team using 60% of cloud infrastructure pays the same as a 3-person legal team | Use activity-based drivers that reflect actual consumption |
| Variance analysis without root cause | "We missed by $200K" is not analysis - it is arithmetic | Every variance above threshold requires a one-sentence root cause and a forward reforecast impact |

## Gotchas

1. **Partial-year headcount math** - A hire starting July 1 costs 6/12 of their annual loaded cost in that fiscal year. Forgetting to prorate new hires is the most common reason department budgets look balanced on paper but come in over on actuals.

2. **Benefits load varies wildly** - 20-30% is a guideline but actual loads vary by country, company size, and plan design. Always confirm the exact employer-side benefits load with HR/payroll before locking headcount budgets - using the wrong rate can misstate OpEx by 5-10%.

3. **Rolling forecast ≠ annual budget** - Treating the rolling forecast as the new annual budget (and tying comp to it) removes the incentive to forecast accurately. Keep the original annual budget as the compensation target; use the rolling forecast only for operational decisions.

4. **Variance timing traps** - A variance that is labeled "timing" (spend shifted quarters) often resurfaces in Q4 as a real overage. Track timing variances separately and flag them if they haven't resolved by month 9.

5. **Allocation method drift** - If you switch cost allocation drivers mid-year (e.g., from headcount to compute units), prior-period comparisons become meaningless. Lock the allocation method at budget time and don't change it within a fiscal year without a full restatement.
