## Key principles

1. **Pay transparency builds trust** - Employees who understand how pay is
   determined are more engaged and less likely to leave over perceived unfairness.
   Document your philosophy, publish band ranges internally, and explain
   progression criteria clearly. Opacity breeds resentment.

2. **Market data, not gut feel** - Compensation decisions made from intuition
   drift out of market over time and introduce bias. Anchor every band to at
   least two external data sources refreshed annually. "We've always paid this
   way" is not a compensation strategy.

3. **Total rewards, not just salary** - Base salary is one line in a larger
   equation. Equity upside, health benefits, PTO policies, remote flexibility,
   and career development all have real economic value. Design and communicate
   the full package - candidates and employees do math.

4. **Equity is a retention tool** - Equity without a vesting schedule is a
   signing bonus. Structure grants to align long-term incentives: 4-year vesting
   with a 1-year cliff is the standard, but refresh grants and accelerated
   vesting on change-of-control matter equally. Design equity with departure
   scenarios in mind.

5. **Review annually at minimum** - Markets move. Inflation erodes purchasing
   power. Competitors raise bands. A compensation structure that was competitive
   18 months ago may be 15% below market today. Schedule mandatory annual
   reviews; trigger ad-hoc reviews when attrition spikes or a survey shows
   significant movement.

## Core concepts

### Compensation components

| Component | Description | Typical form |
|---|---|---|
| Base salary | Fixed annual cash paid on regular schedule | Bi-weekly or semi-monthly paycheck |
| Variable/bonus | Performance-linked cash paid periodically | Annual bonus, quarterly MBO, commission |
| Equity | Ownership stake in the company | ISOs, NSOs, RSUs, ESPP |
| Benefits | Non-cash protections and programs | Health, dental, vision, 401(k) match |
| Perks | Discretionary extras | Remote stipend, L&D budget, PTO |

**Total compensation (TC)** = base + expected bonus + annualized equity value + benefits value.
When comparing offers or setting bands, always use TC - base-only comparisons
are misleading, especially at senior levels where equity is the majority of value.

### Market percentiles

Compensation surveys report pay at percentiles of the market. The standard
anchor points:

| Percentile | What it means | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| P25 | 25% of market pays less | Below-market, acceptable for high-equity early-stage |
| P50 (median) | Middle of market | Default anchor for most companies |
| P75 | 25% of market pays more | Above-market, used to compete for talent in hot roles |
| P90 | Top decile | Reserved for critical roles or FAANG-adjacent competition |

Most companies target P50 base + P75 equity, or P75 base + P50 equity. Decide
your strategy based on what stage you are at and where you want to compete.

### Pay bands

A pay band (or salary range) defines the minimum, midpoint, and maximum for a
given level. Key parameters:

- **Spread**: max - min, expressed as a percentage of the midpoint. Typically
  50-80% for individual contributor roles. Wider bands allow more flexibility;
  narrower bands reduce manager discretion.
- **Midpoint**: the target market rate (usually P50 or P75 of survey data).
- **Overlap**: adjacent bands share some salary range, allowing a high performer
  at L3 to earn more than a new hire at L4 without an immediate promotion.
- **Compa-ratio**: employee's salary / midpoint. 100% = exactly at midpoint.
  Ranges of 85-115% are typical. Outside this range triggers a review.

### Equity types

ISOs (Incentive Stock Options), NSOs (Non-Qualified Stock Options), and RSUs
(Restricted Stock Units) are the three main forms. See
`references/equity-guide.md` for detailed comparison, tax treatment, and vesting
patterns.

### Vesting schedules

The standard is 4-year total vesting with a 1-year cliff:

```
Year 1: 0% vests (cliff period) -> 25% vests at 12-month cliff
Years 2-4: monthly vesting at 1/48th of total grant per month
```

Variations to know:
- **Back-weighted vesting** (10/20/30/40): rewards long tenure, retains people
  longer but feels unfair early on
- **Monthly from day one** (no cliff): common at later-stage or public companies
  for senior hires
- **Refresh grants**: new grants issued annually or at promotion to top up
  unvested equity and reset retention incentives
- **Acceleration**: single-trigger (on change of control) or double-trigger
  (on change of control + involuntary termination) - always use double-trigger
  for employees

## Common tasks

### Benchmark a role against market

**Goal:** Determine whether current or proposed pay is competitive.

**Data sources by use case:**

| Source | Best for | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Levels.fyi | Public tech companies, IC engineering/PM | Free |
| Carta Total Comp | Startups (pre-IPO), equity benchmarking | Paid |
| Radford (Aon) | Enterprise tech, broad job families | Paid (survey participation) |
| Mercer | Non-tech industries, HR and operations roles | Paid |
| Glassdoor / LinkedIn Salary | Directional check, wide variance | Free |
| Option Impact / J.Thelander | VC-backed startup equity norms | Paid |

**Methodology:**
1. Define the job family and level precisely (use internal level definitions)
2. Pull data from at least two sources at the same percentile target
3. Normalize to the same geographic region (use location factors for remote roles)
4. Compare TC, not just base (include equity at current 409A or public price)
5. Document sources, date pulled, and percentile used - this becomes the audit trail

> If two sources diverge by more than 15%, pull a third source and average the
> two closest. Do not cherry-pick the lowest to justify underpaying.

### Design pay bands

**Step-by-step:**

1. Decide your percentile target (P50 for market-rate, P75 for above-market)
2. Set the midpoint to that percentile for each level
3. Apply a spread: 50% spread means min = midpoint * 0.75, max = midpoint * 1.25
4. Check band overlap: adjacent bands should overlap 15-25% to allow flexibility
5. Validate existing employees fall within or near their band (flag outliers)
6. Set a review cadence (annually minimum; trigger on survey data shifts >5%)

**Example band structure for a 4-level IC track:**

| Level | Midpoint | Min (75%) | Max (125%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | $100k | $75k | $125k |
| L2 | $130k | $98k | $163k |
| L3 | $170k | $128k | $213k |
| L4 | $220k | $165k | $275k |

> Bands should be wide enough to reward growth within a level without requiring
> promotion, but narrow enough that managers cannot rationalize dramatically
> underpaying new hires.

### Structure equity grants

Equity grant amounts depend on company stage, role level, and market norms.
Starting guidelines (adjust for company-specific dilution expectations):

| Stage | Level | Typical initial grant | Form |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seed (pre-product) | Senior IC | 0.25-0.75% | Common / ISO |
| Series A | Senior IC | 0.10-0.30% | ISO |
| Series B/C | Staff / L5 | 0.05-0.15% | ISO |
| Series D+ / late stage | Staff / L5 | 0.02-0.06% | ISO or RSU |
| Public company | Staff / L5 | $150k-$400k value | RSU |

**Grant sizing process:**
1. Determine grant value in dollars (use 409A for private; use 30/60/90-day
   average for public)
2. Divide by share/unit price to get share count
3. Set a 4-year vesting schedule with 1-year cliff (standard)
4. Document the refresh cadence (typically annual, sized at 25% of initial grant)

### Build a leveling framework

A leveling framework defines career progression expectations. The minimum
a useful framework must specify per level:

- **Scope**: what is the person responsible for? (task, project, domain, org)
- **Impact**: what outcomes are expected? (individual, team, company)
- **Execution**: how do they work? (guidance needed, independent, leads others)
- **Communication**: who do they influence? (peers, team, leadership, external)

**IC track skeleton (5 levels):**

| Level | Title | Scope | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Associate | Assigned tasks | Completes reliably with mentorship |
| L2 | Mid-level | Small projects | Delivers independently |
| L3 | Senior | Full projects, owns domain | Elevates team quality |
| L4 | Staff | Cross-team initiatives | Org-level influence |
| L5 | Principal | Company-wide problems | Sets technical direction |

Add a parallel management track starting at the Senior equivalent where team
leads split from IC. Keep the IC track viable all the way - not everyone wants
to manage and forcing the path creates attrition.

### Design a total rewards package

Total rewards = compensation + benefits + perks + culture/career. When
structuring a package for a role or level:

1. **Anchor base salary** to market data at your chosen percentile
2. **Set equity** using stage-appropriate grant sizing guidelines above
3. **Layer benefits**: health (medical/dental/vision), 401(k) with match,
   life/disability insurance - these are table-stakes for any full-time role
4. **Add perks** that align with your culture: remote stipends, L&D budgets,
   wellness allowances, parental leave beyond statutory minimums
5. **Document the full TC** in offer letters and annual statements so employees
   understand the total value - most people underestimate the cost of benefits

> Remote-first companies: publish a location factor policy upfront. Paying
> San Francisco rates to everyone is expensive; paying rural rates to people
> in NYC creates resentment. Tiered geographic zones are the standard approach.

### Handle pay equity audits

Pay equity audits detect and correct unjustified pay differences between
employees doing similar work, typically analyzed by gender, race, and ethnicity.

**Audit process:**
1. Define comparable groups (same level, same job family, similar tenure band)
2. Run regression analysis controlling for legitimate pay factors (level, tenure,
   performance rating, location)
3. Calculate adjusted pay gaps: differences remaining after controlling for
   legitimate factors
4. Set a remediation threshold (commonly: flag gaps >5% in adjusted analysis)
5. Correct identified gaps in the next compensation cycle, not "eventually"
6. Repeat annually; document findings and remediation actions

> Conducting an audit does not create legal liability - failing to conduct one
> and being unable to explain pay gaps does. The audit creates the paper trail
> that demonstrates good-faith effort.

### Communicate compensation philosophy

A compensation philosophy statement answers five questions:
1. What market percentile do we target and why?
2. How do we think about total rewards vs. cash-only?
3. How is equity structured and what does it mean for employees?
4. How does pay progress with performance and tenure?
5. How often do we review and adjust pay?

Write it in plain language. Avoid jargon. Publish it to all employees, not
just HR. Update it when strategy changes. A philosophy that cannot be explained
in a 10-minute conversation is not a philosophy - it is a policy document that
no one will read.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Setting pay from the last person's salary | Anchors new hire pay to arbitrary history, not market; propagates historical bias | Pull fresh market data for every open role before setting the offer range |
| Exploding or "take it or leave it" offers | Creates resentment, signals bad faith, and causes candidates to question company culture | Give candidates reasonable time (3-5 business days minimum) and explain all components |
| No equity refresh grants | Unvested equity drops to zero at tenure milestones; employees become "golden handcuff free" and leave | Issue annual refreshes sized at 25-50% of initial grant; tie to performance rating |
| Compression - new hires paid more than tenured employees | Destroys morale when discovered; tenure becomes a penalty | Audit for compression when setting new hire offers; adjust tenured pay in same cycle |
| Subjective performance ratings driving pay | Introduces manager bias into compensation; obscures actual criteria | Use calibrated, criteria-based performance rubrics tied to level expectations |
| Designing equity without tax guidance | Employees make poor exercise decisions due to AMT, 83(b) elections, and QSBS; creates legal exposure | Provide a tax FAQ, recommend personal tax advisors, and document ISO/NSO differences |

---

## Gotchas

1. **ISO exercise triggers AMT** - Exercising Incentive Stock Options creates a tax preference item that can trigger Alternative Minimum Tax, even if the employee doesn't sell the shares. Employees who exercise a large ISO grant in a high-valuation year can owe six-figure AMT bills on paper gains that aren't yet liquid. Always flag the AMT risk and recommend personal tax advice before any ISO exercise.

2. **Pay compression discovered at offer stage** - A new hire offer above the band midpoint that crosses or approaches a tenured employee's salary creates compression. If the tenured employee finds out (and they often do), it destroys morale and accelerates attrition. Audit the band for compression before finalizing any offer, not after.

3. **Equity value communicated as strike price, not FMV** - Candidates often misunderstand option grants because the hiring team presents the strike price ("you get options at $0.50/share") without explaining current 409A fair market value and the implied spread. Communicate equity value as both the grant size and the estimated current value so candidates can do real math.

4. **Geographic pay policy announced after hiring** - Introducing a location-tiered pay policy after hiring remote employees at a flat rate triggers immediate resentment. Those hired at SF rates and later adjusted to their local tier feel a retroactive pay cut. Establish and communicate the geographic policy before the first offer, not when the policy becomes a cost problem.

5. **Refresh grant eligibility not documented** - If the company has no written policy on who gets refresh grants and when, managers informally grant them to favorites and skip others with equal performance. This becomes a pay equity finding and a legal exposure. Document the refresh cadence, eligibility criteria, and sizing formula before the first refresh cycle.

## References

For detailed guidance on specific compensation topics, read the relevant file
from the `references/` folder:

- `references/equity-guide.md` - ISO vs NSO vs RSU comparison, vesting patterns,
  tax treatment, early exercise, 83(b) elections, QSBS

Only load a references file when the current task specifically requires it -
they are detailed and will consume context.
