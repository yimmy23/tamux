## Key principles

1. **Data hygiene is non-negotiable** - A CRM full of stale, duplicated, or
   manually-entered guesswork is worse than no CRM. Garbage in, garbage out
   applies to forecasts, reports, and automation. Treat data quality as a
   first-class engineering concern: define ownership, set decay rules, and
   automate enrichment from day one.

2. **Automate the boring stuff** - Reps should spend time selling, not updating
   fields. Any task that follows a predictable rule (create follow-up task when
   stage advances, notify manager when deal exceeds threshold, enrich lead on
   creation) should be automated. Human judgment is reserved for exceptions.

3. **Pipeline reflects reality** - Every stage must represent a verifiable buyer
   action, not a rep's optimism. Stages without exit criteria are opinions. Exit
   criteria must be objective and observable: "Demo completed" not "Rep thinks
   they're interested." Review pipeline stages whenever win rates diverge from
   forecast accuracy.

4. **Forecast with methodology** - Never let reps enter a single probability
   number. Pick one forecasting method (weighted, categorical, or AI) and apply
   it consistently. Mix methods only at the rollup layer. A forecast is only as
   good as the pipeline data behind it - fix pipeline hygiene before blaming
   the model.

5. **Less fields, more adoption** - Every field added to a record is friction.
   Every required field that reps don't understand is a source of garbage data.
   Audit fields quarterly: if a field hasn't been used in reporting in 90 days,
   archive it. Default to fewer, well-defined fields with validation rules over
   many optional ones nobody fills in.

## Core concepts

### CRM object model

CRM platforms organize data around a standard object hierarchy. Understanding
the relationships prevents misdesign.

| Object | Represents | Key relationships |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead** | An unqualified inbound contact, not yet associated to an account | Converts to Contact + Account + Opportunity |
| **Contact** | A known individual at a company | Belongs to Account; linked to Opportunities |
| **Account** | A company or organization | Parent of Contacts and Opportunities |
| **Opportunity** | A specific deal or revenue event in progress | Belongs to Account; has a Stage, Amount, and Close Date |

**Lead vs Contact:** Leads are pre-qualification. Once a lead meets your ICP
criteria (or a sales rep accepts it), convert it. Do not store active selling
conversations on Lead records - move to Opportunity.

**Account hierarchy:** Enterprise deals often span subsidiaries. Model parent-child
account relationships to roll up ARR accurately.

### Pipeline stages

A pipeline stage is a milestone in the buyer's journey, not the seller's activity.
Each stage must have:

- **Name**: Short, buyer-centric label
- **Definition**: What is true about the buyer at this stage
- **Entry criteria**: What must have happened to move in
- **Exit criteria**: What must happen before advancing
- **Probability**: Default win probability used in weighted forecasting

### Deal properties

Standard properties every opportunity should carry:

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `amount` | Currency | ACV or total contract value |
| `close_date` | Date | Expected close, used in forecasting |
| `stage` | Enum | Current pipeline stage |
| `forecast_category` | Enum | Committed / Best Case / Pipeline / Omitted |
| `deal_source` | Enum | Inbound / Outbound / Channel / Expansion |
| `next_step` | Text | Single next action with owner and date |
| `competitor` | Multi-select | Competitors actively in the deal |
| `loss_reason` | Enum | Required on Closed Lost; drives win/loss analysis |

### Automation triggers

CRM workflows are event-driven. Standard trigger types:

- **Record create** - runs when an object is first created (lead created, deal opened)
- **Field change** - runs when a specific field value changes (stage advances, amount updates)
- **Time-based** - runs N days before/after a date field (deal stale for 14 days, close date in 7 days)
- **Criteria match** - runs when a record first matches a filter (deal amount > $50k, lead score > 80)

## Common tasks

### Design pipeline stages

Define stages bottom-up: start from Closed Won and work backward to the first
meaningful buyer commitment. A typical B2B SaaS pipeline:

| Stage | Definition | Exit criteria | Default probability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prospecting | Identified as target, no contact yet | Meeting booked | 5% |
| Discovery | First meeting held; pain and budget being explored | Discovery call completed, MEDDIC/BANT fields populated | 15% |
| Demo / Evaluation | Product demonstrated; evaluating fit | Demo completed; champion identified | 30% |
| Proposal | Pricing and scope sent | Verbal interest in proposal | 50% |
| Negotiation | Legal or commercial back-and-forth | Legal review initiated | 70% |
| Closed Won | Contract signed | Signed document received | 100% |
| Closed Lost | Deal dead | Loss reason entered | 0% |

> More than 7 active stages is almost always too many. Stages that reps skip
> consistently signal the stage does not reflect a real buyer milestone.

For SaaS, enterprise, and PLG templates, see `references/pipeline-templates.md`.

### Set up lead scoring in CRM

Lead scoring combines demographic fit (ICP match) and behavioral engagement.
Use two dimensions to avoid conflating them:

**Profile score (ICP fit):**
- Company size in target range: +15
- Industry match: +20
- Job title is economic buyer or champion: +25
- Geography in territory: +10
- Technology stack match (from enrichment): +15

**Engagement score (interest signals):**
- Demo request or pricing page visit: +30
- Email open: +2, Email click: +8
- Webinar attendance: +15
- Free trial signup: +25
- Score decay: -5 per week of inactivity

**Routing rule:** Route to sales when profile score >= 40 AND engagement score >= 30.
Never route on engagement alone - a curious student visiting your pricing page is
not an MQL.

### Build a forecasting model

Choose one primary methodology. Do not mix until you understand the trade-offs.

**Weighted pipeline (default):**
- Multiply opportunity amount by stage probability
- Sum across all open deals in a period
- Works when: stages are well-defined, reps update stages accurately
- Breaks when: reps sandbag or inflate stages to manage their number

**Categorical (commit-based):**
- Each rep assigns a forecast category: Committed, Best Case, Pipeline, Omitted
- Manager rolls up by taking Committed as floor, Best Case as upside
- Works when: reps are disciplined about commit culture
- Breaks when: reps over-commit to look good or under-commit to sandbag

**AI / predictive:**
- CRM platform (Salesforce Einstein, HubSpot AI) scores each deal on close likelihood
- Based on historical signals: stage velocity, engagement, deal age, competitor presence
- Works when: you have 12+ months of clean historical data (200+ won/lost deals)
- Do not use if your data is less than a year old or heavily incomplete

**Rollup structure:** Rep -> Manager -> VP -> CRO. Each level reviews the layer
below before submitting up. Lock forecasts weekly on Monday; review actuals Friday.

### Automate deal progression workflows

Automate repetitive mechanics, not judgment calls. Standard automation patterns:

| Trigger | Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Opportunity stage = Demo | Create task: "Send follow-up email within 24h" assigned to owner | Enforces follow-through |
| Opportunity stage = Proposal | Notify manager via Slack | Deal visibility |
| Opportunity amount > $50k | Flag as "Strategic Deal", notify VP | Escalation routing |
| Close date passes with stage not Closed | Send stale deal alert to rep and manager | Pipeline hygiene |
| Lead created from website form | Enrich via Clearbit/Apollo, route by territory | Speed to lead |
| Deal moves to Closed Lost | Require loss_reason before save | Win/loss data integrity |

> Automation should enforce process, not replace it. If an automation creates
> a task that reps always dismiss, the process is wrong, not the automation.

### Maintain data hygiene

Data hygiene has four levers: deduplication, enrichment, decay management, and
field governance.

**Deduplication:**
- Run dedup rules on email (primary key for contacts), domain (primary key for accounts)
- Use fuzzy matching for company names (Acme Corp vs Acme Corporation vs Acme, Inc.)
- Set merge rules: retain the older record's ID, take the newer record's field values
- Run dedup on import and on a scheduled weekly job

**Enrichment:**
- Auto-enrich new leads and accounts from data providers (Clearbit, ZoomInfo, Apollo)
- Enrich fields: company size, industry, technology stack, LinkedIn URL, phone
- Re-enrich accounts on a 90-day schedule to catch firmographic changes
- Do not overwrite manually-entered values with enriched values without review

**Decay management:**
- Mark leads as "stale" if no activity in 60 days; remove from active scoring
- Archive opportunities with no stage movement in 90 days (move to pipeline hold stage)
- Purge GDPR-regulated contacts on schedule per data retention policy

**Field governance:**
- Audit all custom fields quarterly: usage rate, last populated date
- Archive fields used in fewer than 20% of records
- Required fields must have picklist validation; free-text required fields breed inconsistency

### Build sales dashboards and reports

Every sales dashboard should answer one of three questions: Where are we? Where
are we going? Why did deals win or lose?

| Dashboard | Key metrics |
|---|---|
| Pipeline health | Open pipeline by stage, pipeline coverage ratio (pipeline / quota), average deal age per stage |
| Forecast | Committed vs Best Case vs quota, forecast vs prior week delta, at-risk deals (close date < 14 days, no activity in 7 days) |
| Activity | Calls, emails, meetings per rep per week; stage conversion rates |
| Win/loss analysis | Win rate by deal source, competitor, deal size, industry; average sales cycle by segment |
| Rep performance | Quota attainment, pipeline created, average deal size, stage conversion funnel |

Report cadences: Daily - pipeline alerts. Weekly - forecast review. Monthly - win/loss and funnel analysis. Quarterly - field governance and process audit.

### Integrate CRM with marketing automation

CRM-MAP integration is a bidirectional sync. Design the data contract carefully:

**CRM to MAP:**
- Sync contact lifecycle stage changes (MQL, SQL, Opportunity, Customer)
- Sync deal stage to suppress active prospects from nurture campaigns
- Sync closed won/lost to trigger onboarding or re-engagement sequences

**MAP to CRM:**
- Write engagement scores back to lead/contact record
- Write last activity date and activity type
- Write campaign attribution (first touch, last touch, multi-touch)

**Sync rules:**
- Define field-level ownership: MAP owns engagement score; CRM owns stage and amount
- Never let MAP overwrite fields that sales reps manually update
- Use a sync log or webhook audit trail so mismatches can be diagnosed

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Stages based on rep activity ("Proposal Sent") | Tracks what the seller did, not what the buyer decided | Redefine stages around verifiable buyer actions and decisions |
| Single probability field reps fill manually | Reps game it to match their gut; forecasts become meaningless | Derive probability from stage; use forecast category for rep judgment |
| Required fields without picklists | Reps type anything to get past validation; data is unqueryable | Replace free-text required fields with controlled picklists |
| CRM fields duplicated in spreadsheets | Shadow systems diverge; actual data is always "in the spreadsheet" | Mandate CRM as system of record; kill the spreadsheets |
| Automating before stages are stable | Automation bakes in bad process; expensive to unwind | Freeze stage definitions for one full quarter before automating |
| Enrichment overwriting sales data | Reps lose trust in CRM when their updates get overwritten | Set enrichment to fill empty fields only; never overwrite |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Automating before stage definitions are stable** - Building workflow automations on top of pipeline stages that are still being debated bakes bad process into code. When stages change, you have to unwind automations, field mappings, and reports simultaneously. Freeze stage definitions for one full quarter before automating them.

2. **Enrichment overwriting sales rep data** - When a data enrichment provider (Clearbit, ZoomInfo) updates a field like company size or industry, it can silently overwrite a value a rep manually entered from a real sales conversation. Reps notice, stop trusting the CRM, and revert to spreadsheets. Configure enrichment to fill empty fields only, never overwrite populated ones.

3. **Lead routing on engagement score alone** - A high engagement score means someone is interested - not that they are a qualified buyer. Routing a university student who visits your pricing page 10 times to sales wastes rep time and trains reps to distrust MQL routing. Always require a minimum profile (ICP fit) score alongside engagement before routing.

4. **Forecast categories without commit culture** - A categorical forecast ("Committed / Best Case / Pipeline") only works if reps treat "Committed" as a hard promise. Without explicit commit culture training and consequences for consistent miss-commits, reps either over-commit to look good or under-commit to sandbag. The methodology is useless without the discipline.

5. **Required free-text fields** - Making a free-text field required (like "Next Steps" as a text box) guarantees garbage data. Reps type anything to save the record: "TBD", "follow up", or nothing meaningful. Replace free-text required fields with picklists that have clear, actionable options.
