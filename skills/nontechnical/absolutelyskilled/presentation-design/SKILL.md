## Key principles

1. **One idea per slide** - Each slide communicates exactly one point. If you need
   a second sentence to explain what the slide is about, split it into two slides.
   Audiences retain messages, not slide counts - more focused slides beat fewer dense ones.

2. **Narrative before visuals** - Always lock in the story arc and outline before
   opening any design tool. A beautiful deck with no narrative thread fails. Write
   the slide titles as a standalone story - if someone reads only the titles in
   sequence, they should understand the full argument.

3. **Signal-to-noise ratio** - Every element on a slide must earn its place. Remove
   logos from interior slides, drop decorative clip art, minimize bullet sub-levels,
   and kill orphan text. The audience's eye should land on exactly what matters with
   zero visual competition.

4. **Data-ink maximization** - For data slides, maximize the proportion of ink used
   to display actual data vs. non-data elements (gridlines, borders, redundant labels).
   Remove chart junk: 3D effects, gradient fills, excessive legends, and dual axes
   unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Context-audience fit** - A board presentation is not a conference keynote is not
   a training workshop. Match density, tone, animation level, and formality to the
   specific audience and setting. Read-ahead decks need more text; live talks need less.

## Core concepts

**Deck architecture** - Every presentation has three layers: the narrative layer (what
story are you telling), the structural layer (how slides are sequenced and grouped),
and the visual layer (how each slide looks). Work top-down through these layers.

**Slide taxonomy** - Slides fall into five functional types: Title/section dividers
(signal transitions), Assertion slides (state a claim with evidence), Data slides
(charts, tables, metrics), Framework slides (2x2 matrices, process flows, diagrams),
and Action slides (next steps, asks, CTAs). Knowing which type you need prevents
the default of "bullet point list for everything."

**Storytelling structures** - The three most versatile frameworks: (1) Situation-
Complication-Resolution (SCR) for executive communication - state the context, reveal
the tension, present the answer. (2) Problem-Solution-Benefit (PSB) for sales and
pitch decks - show the pain, offer the fix, prove the value. (3) The Pyramid Principle
(Minto) for analytical presentations - lead with the conclusion, then support with
grouped arguments and evidence.

**Visual hierarchy** - Slide elements are read in priority order: headline first,
then the dominant visual element, then supporting text. Use size, contrast, color,
and position to control this reading order. The headline should be an assertion
("Revenue grew 23% YoY"), not a label ("Revenue").

**Data visualization selection** - Match chart type to the analytical message:
comparison (bar chart), trend over time (line chart), part-to-whole (stacked bar or
pie for 2-3 segments only), distribution (histogram), correlation (scatter plot),
flow (Sankey or waterfall). The chart type IS the argument.

## Common tasks

### Structure a presentation from scratch

Follow this sequence:
1. Define the objective in one sentence: "After this presentation, the audience will ___"
2. Identify the audience and context (live talk, read-ahead, hybrid)
3. Choose a storytelling framework (SCR, PSB, or Pyramid - see `references/storytelling-frameworks.md`)
4. Write 8-15 slide titles that tell the story when read in sequence
5. Classify each slide by type (title, assertion, data, framework, action)
6. Draft content for each slide - one key message per slide
7. Identify which slides need data visualization and select chart types
8. Add a strong opening slide (hook) and closing slide (call to action)

> Always validate: read the slide titles alone top to bottom. If the narrative is unclear, restructure before adding any visual content.

### Build a pitch deck

Standard pitch deck structure (10-12 slides):
1. **Title** - Company name, one-line value prop, presenter name
2. **Problem** - The pain point, sized with data if possible
3. **Solution** - What you built, shown simply (screenshot or diagram)
4. **Demo/Product** - How it works in 2-3 steps
5. **Market** - TAM/SAM/SOM or market sizing
6. **Business model** - How you make money
7. **Traction** - Metrics, growth chart, logos, testimonials
8. **Competition** - Positioning matrix (2x2) or comparison table
9. **Team** - Key founders and relevant experience
10. **Ask** - Funding amount, use of funds, timeline
11. **Appendix** - Detailed financials, technical architecture (backup slides)

> Keep the pitch deck under 15 slides for the main flow. Use appendix slides for depth.

### Choose the right chart for data slides

| Message type | Best chart | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Comparison across categories | Horizontal bar | Pie chart with 5+ segments |
| Trend over time | Line chart | Vertical bar with 12+ bars |
| Part-to-whole (2-3 parts) | Pie or donut | Stacked bar |
| Part-to-whole (4+ parts) | Stacked bar or treemap | Pie chart |
| Distribution | Histogram or box plot | Bar chart with raw values |
| Correlation | Scatter plot | Dual-axis line chart |
| Change/waterfall | Waterfall chart | Stacked bar |
| Process flow | Sankey or flow diagram | Table |

See `references/data-visualization.md` for detailed formatting rules, labeling
best practices, and color palette guidance.

### Write assertion headlines

Transform label headlines into assertion headlines:

| Weak (label) | Strong (assertion) |
|---|---|
| "Q3 Revenue" | "Q3 revenue exceeded target by 12%" |
| "Customer Feedback" | "NPS jumped from 32 to 58 after redesign" |
| "Market Overview" | "The $4.2B market is shifting to self-serve" |
| "Team" | "Our founding team has 3 successful exits" |

Every slide headline should be a complete sentence that states the takeaway. If the
audience reads nothing else, they get the message.

### Design data-heavy slides

For slides with complex data:
1. Lead with the insight headline - state what the data proves
2. Use one chart per slide (two maximum if directly compared)
3. Highlight the key data point with color or annotation
4. Remove gridlines, reduce axis labels to minimum needed
5. Add a direct annotation or callout on the chart pointing to the insight
6. Source the data in small text at bottom-left
7. Use consistent color coding across all data slides in the deck

> Never show a chart without telling the audience what to see in it. The headline and a callout annotation do this work.

### Structure a read-ahead document deck

Read-ahead decks (sent via email, read without a presenter) need different rules:
1. Use full-sentence headlines (assertions) - they carry the argument alone
2. Include more text per slide than a live talk (but still concise)
3. Add executive summary as slide 2 (after title) - full argument in 5-6 bullets
4. Use page numbers and section headers for navigation
5. Include a table of contents for decks over 15 slides
6. Appendix is critical - readers will want to drill into details
7. Minimize animations and builds - they don't work in PDF/email

### Apply visual hierarchy to a slide

Checklist for every content slide:
1. Headline: 24-32pt, bold, top of slide - states the assertion
2. Primary visual: largest element, center or center-right - chart, image, or diagram
3. Supporting text: 14-18pt, left-aligned, minimal - 2-4 bullet points maximum
4. Source/footnote: 10-12pt, bottom-left, gray - attribution only
5. Whitespace: at least 15-20% of slide area is empty - don't fill every pixel
6. Consistent margins: same padding on all four edges across all slides

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Wall of bullets | Audiences stop reading after 3 bullets; retention drops to near zero | One idea per slide; use visuals to replace lists |
| Label headlines ("Q3 Results") | Forces audience to find the point themselves; wasted real estate | Assertion headlines that state the takeaway |
| Pie chart with 6+ segments | Humans cannot compare arc angles accurately beyond 3 segments | Use horizontal bar chart sorted by value |
| Reading slides aloud verbatim | Audience reads faster than you speak; creates cognitive conflict | Slides show the visual; you provide the narration |
| No clear ask or CTA | Presentation ends without the audience knowing what to do next | Final slide states the specific desired action |
| Decorative chart junk | 3D effects, gradients, unnecessary gridlines distract from data | Flat, clean charts with data-ink ratio maximized |
| Inconsistent formatting | Different fonts, colors, alignment slide-to-slide breaks trust | Use a master template; enforce consistency |
| Too many slides for the time | Rushing through slides signals poor preparation | Target 1-2 minutes per slide for live talks |

## Gotchas

1. **Deck sent as read-ahead but designed for live delivery fails both use cases** - A deck with minimal text, large visuals, and no context reads as confusing to someone receiving it by email. Conversely, a read-ahead deck with dense prose is death-by-slide in a live presentation. Decide the delivery format before slide 1 and design accordingly. If you need both, build a "speaker version" and a "leave-behind version" as separate files.

2. **"Most Popular" badge on the middle tier backfires if the middle tier is empty** - Social proof on a pricing tier or comparison slide (e.g., marking the middle column as "most popular") loses credibility if the content doesn't justify it. The badge should reinforce a natural gravitational pull, not substitute for it. Ensure the middle tier genuinely offers the best value proposition before adding the badge.

3. **Pie charts with more than 4 segments are consistently misread** - Humans cannot accurately compare arc lengths when there are 5+ segments. Audiences in live presentations have no time to study the chart. If a pie chart has more than 3-4 meaningful segments, replace it with a sorted horizontal bar chart immediately. This is the single most common data visualization error in business presentations.

4. **Dark slide backgrounds render poorly in bright conference rooms** - A dark-theme deck that looks stunning on a monitor can become near-unreadable when projected in a daylight-lit conference room with a low-lumen projector. Test your deck in the actual room or use a high-contrast theme with at least 7:1 contrast ratio for any text on background.

5. **Animations and transitions in exported PDF break the read-ahead experience** - Build and reveal animations (text appearing line by line, chart bars animating in) are invisible in PDFs sent for async review - readers see only the final state. If a slide's argument depends on the reveal order, add numbers or explicit visual cues to the exported version, or duplicate the slide in a progressive state for PDF exports.
