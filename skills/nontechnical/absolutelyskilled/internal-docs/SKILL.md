  Use this skill when writing, reviewing, or improving internal engineering documents
  - RFCs, design docs, post-mortems, runbooks, and knowledge base articles. Triggers
  on drafting a design proposal, writing an RFC, creating a post-mortem after an
  incident, building an operational runbook, organizing team knowledge, or improving
  existing documentation for clarity and completeness.

## Key principles

1. **Write for the reader, not the writer** - Every document exists to transfer
   knowledge to someone else. Identify who will read it (decision-makers, on-call
   engineers, new hires) and structure for their needs, not your thought process.

2. **Decisions over descriptions** - The most valuable internal docs capture the
   "why" behind choices. A design doc that only describes the solution without
   explaining alternatives considered and tradeoffs made is incomplete.

3. **Actionability is everything** - A runbook that says "investigate the issue"
   is worthless. A post-mortem without concrete action items is theater. Every
   document should leave the reader knowing exactly what to do next.

4. **Living documents decay** - Docs that aren't maintained become dangerous.
   Every document needs an owner and a review cadence, or it should be marked
   with an explicit expiration date.

5. **Structure enables skimming** - Engineers don't read docs linearly. Use
   headers, TL;DRs, tables, and callouts so readers can find what they need
   in under 30 seconds.

## Core concepts

Internal docs fall into four categories, each with a distinct lifecycle and audience:

**Decision documents** (RFCs, design docs, ADRs) propose a change, gather feedback,
and record the final decision. They flow through draft, review, approved/rejected
states. The audience is peers and stakeholders who need to evaluate the proposal.
See `references/rfcs-and-design-docs.md`.

**Incident documents** (post-mortems, incident reviews) are written after something
goes wrong. They reconstruct the timeline, identify root causes, and produce action
items. The audience is the broader engineering org learning from failure. Blamelessness
is non-negotiable. See `references/post-mortems.md`.

**Operational documents** (runbooks, playbooks, SOPs) provide step-by-step procedures
for recurring tasks or incident response. The audience is the on-call engineer at
3 AM who needs to fix something fast. See `references/runbooks.md`.

**Knowledge documents** (wikis, guides, onboarding docs, team pages) preserve
institutional knowledge. The audience varies but typically includes new team members
and cross-team collaborators. See `references/knowledge-management.md`.

## Common tasks

### Draft an RFC

An RFC proposes a significant technical change and invites structured feedback.
Use this template structure:

```markdown
# RFC: <Title>

**Author:** <name>  **Status:** Draft | In Review | Approved | Rejected
**Created:** <date>  **Last updated:** <date>
**Reviewers:** <list>  **Decision deadline:** <date>

## TL;DR
<2-3 sentences: what you propose and why>

## Motivation
<What problem does this solve? Why now? What happens if we do nothing?>

## Proposal
<The detailed solution. Include diagrams, data models, API contracts as needed.>

## Alternatives considered
<At least 2 alternatives with honest pros/cons for each>

## Tradeoffs and risks
<What are we giving up? What could go wrong? How do we mitigate?>

## Rollout plan
<How will this be implemented incrementally? Feature flags? Migration?>

## Open questions
<Unresolved items that need input from reviewers>
```

> Always include at least two genuine alternatives. A single-option RFC signals
> the decision was made before the review process started.

### Write a post-mortem

Post-mortems extract organizational learning from incidents. Follow a blameless
approach - focus on systems and processes, never on individuals.

```markdown
# Post-Mortem: <Incident title>

**Date of incident:** <date>  **Severity:** SEV-1 | SEV-2 | SEV-3
**Author:** <name>  **Status:** Draft | Review | Final
**Time to detect:** <duration>  **Time to resolve:** <duration>

## Summary
<3-4 sentences: what happened, who was affected, and the impact>

## Timeline
| Time (UTC) | Event |
|---|---|
| HH:MM | <what happened> |

## Root cause
<The deepest "why" - use the 5 Whys technique to go beyond symptoms>

## Contributing factors
<Other conditions that made the incident possible or worse>

## What went well
<Things that worked during response - detection, communication, tooling>

## What went poorly
<Process or system gaps exposed by the incident>

## Action items
| Action | Owner | Priority | Due date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <specific action> | <name> | P0/P1/P2 | <date> | Open |
```

> Every action item must be specific, assigned, and dated. "Improve monitoring"
> is not an action item. "Add latency p99 alert on checkout service at 500ms
> threshold" is.

### Create a runbook

Runbooks provide step-by-step procedures for operational tasks. Write them for
the worst case: an engineer who has never seen this system, at 3 AM, under stress.

```markdown
# Runbook: <Procedure name>

**Owner:** <team>  **Last verified:** <date>
**Estimated time:** <duration>  **Risk level:** Low | Medium | High

## When to use
<Trigger conditions - what alert, symptom, or request leads here>

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Access to <system>
- [ ] Permissions: <specific roles or credentials needed>

## Steps

### Step 1: <Action>
<Exact command or UI action. No ambiguity.>
```bash
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=checkout
```

**Expected output:** <what you should see if things are working>
**If this fails:** <what to do - escalation path or alternative>

### Step 2: <Action>
...

## Rollback
<How to undo everything if the procedure goes wrong>

## Escalation
<Who to contact if the runbook doesn't resolve the issue>
```

> Test every runbook by having someone unfamiliar with the system follow it.
> If they get stuck, the runbook is incomplete.

### Write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

ADRs are lightweight, immutable records of a single architectural decision.

```markdown
# ADR-<NNN>: <Decision title>

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-<NNN>
**Date:** <date>  **Deciders:** <names>

## Context
<What forces are at play? What constraint or opportunity triggered this decision?>

## Decision
<The change we are making. State it clearly in one paragraph.>

## Consequences
<What becomes easier? What becomes harder? What are the risks?>
```

> ADRs are append-only. If a decision is reversed, write a new ADR that supersedes
> the old one. Never edit a finalized ADR.

### Review an existing document for quality

Walk through the doc checking these dimensions in order:

1. **Audience** - Is it clear who this is for? Does the depth match their expertise?
2. **Structure** - Can a reader find what they need by skimming headers?
3. **Completeness** - Are there gaps that will generate questions?
4. **Actionability** - Does the reader know what to do after reading?
5. **Freshness** - Is the information current? Are there stale references?
6. **Conciseness** - Can anything be cut without losing meaning?

### Organize a knowledge base

Structure team knowledge around these four categories (adapted from Divio):

| Category | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Tutorials | Learning-oriented, step-by-step | "Setting up local dev environment" |
| How-to guides | Task-oriented, problem-solving | "How to deploy a canary release" |
| Reference | Information-oriented, accurate | "API rate limits by tier" |
| Explanation | Understanding-oriented, context | "Why we chose event sourcing" |

> Avoid dumping all docs into a flat wiki. Tag documents by category, team, and
> system so they remain discoverable as the org scales.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Wall of text | No headers, no TL;DR, no structure - nobody will read it | Add TL;DR upfront, use headers every 3-5 paragraphs, use tables for structured data |
| Blame in post-mortems | Naming individuals creates fear and suppresses honest reporting | Focus on system and process failures. "The deploy pipeline lacked a canary step" not "Bob deployed without checking" |
| Runbook with "use judgment" | On-call engineers under stress cannot exercise judgment on unfamiliar systems | Provide explicit decision trees with concrete thresholds |
| RFC without alternatives | Signals the decision is already made and review is theater | Always include 2+ genuine alternatives with honest tradeoffs |
| Stale documentation | Outdated docs are worse than no docs - they build false confidence | Set review dates, assign owners, archive aggressively |
| Copy-paste templates | Filling a template mechanically without adapting to context | Templates are starting points - remove irrelevant sections, add context-specific ones |
| No action items | Post-mortems and reviews that identify problems but assign no follow-up | Every identified gap must produce a specific, assigned, dated action item |

## Gotchas

1. **RFCs without a decision deadline stay in "review" forever** - An RFC without a deadline becomes a perpetual discussion that blocks implementation. Always set a concrete decision deadline (typically 1-2 weeks) in the frontmatter, and explicitly close the RFC as Approved or Rejected on that date even if not everyone has commented.

2. **Post-mortems written more than a week after the incident lose critical detail** - Memory degrades fast. Timelines reconstructed from memory a week later miss key decision points and often misattribute causality. The IC should assign a post-mortem owner and require a draft timeline within 24 hours of resolution, even if the full document takes 5 days.

3. **ADRs edited retroactively destroy the historical record** - An ADR is only valuable as a record of what was decided and why at a specific point in time. If you update an ADR to reflect a changed decision, future readers can't distinguish the original context from the revision. Write a new ADR that supersedes the old one; mark the old one "Superseded by ADR-NNN".

4. **Runbooks with "check the dashboard" as a step fail at 3 AM** - "Check the monitoring dashboard" is not a runbook step. A runbook step specifies which dashboard, which panel, what a normal reading looks like, and what to do if it's abnormal. Vague steps require context the on-call engineer won't have. Every step needs a specific action, an expected result, and a failure path.

5. **Wiki pages without owners decay into organizational memory holes** - A wiki page written once and never reviewed will be confidently wrong within 6-12 months for any actively developed system. Every page needs a named owner and a "Last verified" date. Unmaintained pages should be archived, not left as false ground truth.
