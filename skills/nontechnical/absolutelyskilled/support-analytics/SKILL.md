# Support Analytics

Support analytics turns raw ticket data into operational intelligence. The goal
is not to generate reports - it is to change behavior. Whether measuring how
satisfied customers are after an interaction, how quickly issues are resolved,
or how often customers find answers without contacting support, every metric
should connect to a decision. This skill covers the full analytics lifecycle:
what to measure, how to measure it, and how to act on what you find.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Wants to set up or improve a CSAT or NPS measurement program
- Needs to track, report on, or reduce resolution time or first-contact resolution
- Asks about deflection rate or self-service effectiveness
- Wants to analyze support ticket trends, topic clusters, or volume forecasting
- Needs to build a support dashboard for an executive, team lead, or agent
- Is creating a support metrics framework or KPI hierarchy
- Asks about survey design, response rate improvement, or score interpretation
- Needs to segment support data by channel, tier, topic, or agent

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Product analytics or funnel metrics (use analytics-engineering instead)
- Infrastructure monitoring, SLOs, or error rate tracking (use backend-engineering instead)

## Key principles

1. **Measure what matters, not what's easy** - Ticket volume is easy to count but
   rarely actionable on its own. Focus on metrics that reveal customer experience
   and operational efficiency: CSAT, resolution time, and deflection rate expose
   the health of your support operation far more than raw volume does.

2. **Benchmarks are starting points, not goals** - Industry benchmarks give you
   a calibration point, not a finish line. A CSAT of 85% may be excellent for a
   complex enterprise product and unacceptable for a consumer app. Compare to
   your own historical trend first; compare to benchmarks second.

3. **Trends matter more than snapshots** - A single week's CSAT score means
   almost nothing. A 12-week trend that is declining 1 point per week means
   something is systematically wrong. Always show time-series data alongside
   point-in-time figures. Week-over-week and month-over-month comparisons prevent
   overreaction to normal variance.

4. **Segment by channel, tier, and topic** - Aggregate scores hide the story.
   A CSAT of 82% overall might mask a chat score of 91% and an email score of
   68%. Segmenting by channel, customer tier, product area, and ticket topic
   reveals where to invest and what is working.

5. **Close the loop - insights to action** - An analytics program that produces
   dashboards no one acts on is a cost center. Every metric should own a DRI
   (directly responsible individual), a target, and a process for escalating when
   the target is missed. The cadence is: measure, review, decide, act, re-measure.

## Core concepts

### Satisfaction metrics

**CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)** - A post-interaction rating, typically
1-5 stars or a thumbs up/down, sent immediately after a ticket closes. Measures
satisfaction with a specific support interaction, not the product overall. The
score is the percentage of positive responses out of total responses received.

**NPS (Net Promoter Score)** - A relationship-level survey asking "How likely
are you to recommend us to a colleague?" on a 0-10 scale. Promoters (9-10) minus
Detractors (0-6) equals the NPS. Transactional NPS (tNPS) is sent after support
interactions to capture loyalty impact from a specific resolution.

**CES (Customer Effort Score)** - Measures how easy it was to get help: "How
much effort did you personally have to put forth to handle your request?" Low
effort correlates with reduced churn more reliably than high satisfaction does.

### Operational metrics

**First Contact Resolution (FCR)** - The percentage of tickets resolved on the
first reply without the customer needing to follow up. High FCR is the single
strongest predictor of high CSAT. Improving FCR reduces cost and improves
satisfaction simultaneously.

**Resolution Time** - The elapsed time from ticket creation to resolution. Report
as median (p50) and p90 to capture both typical experience and worst-case outliers.
Segment by ticket priority, channel, and topic - a blanket average hides whether
P1 bugs are being prioritized over billing questions.

**Handle Time** - Agent-active time spent on a ticket (not elapsed clock time).
Useful for capacity planning and identifying where agents need tooling or training
improvements.

**Reopen Rate** - Percentage of resolved tickets reopened by the customer. A high
reopen rate indicates resolutions are incomplete or unclear, or that the underlying
issue is recurring.

### Self-service metrics

**Deflection Rate** - The percentage of potential support contacts handled by
self-service (docs, chatbot, FAQ) without reaching a human. Calculated as
`deflections / (deflections + human contacts)`. Hard to measure precisely -
proxy methods include doc views before ticket submission and chatbot resolution
rates.

**Article Effectiveness** - For knowledge bases: the percentage of doc views
that end without a support ticket being submitted. Track alongside
search-with-no-results counts to identify content gaps.

**Containment Rate** - For chatbots and IVR: the percentage of sessions that
reach a resolution without escalating to a human. A session can be contained
but still leave the customer unsatisfied - always pair with a satisfaction signal.

### Quality metrics

**QA Score** - Internal quality assurance review of ticket handling: tone,
accuracy, policy adherence, completeness. Typically sampled (5-10% of tickets)
and scored on a rubric. Correlates with CSAT but catches issues that surveys miss
such as correct but cold responses.

**Agent CSAT** - CSAT segmented by individual agent. Useful for coaching, not
for ranking. Agents on complex ticket queues will have lower scores than agents
on simple billing questions - normalize by ticket type before comparing agents.

## Common tasks

### Set up a metrics framework - KPI hierarchy

Build a three-tier hierarchy: strategic, operational, and diagnostic.

| Tier | Audience | Cadence | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic | Leadership | Monthly / Quarterly | NPS, CSAT trend, cost-per-ticket, deflection rate |
| Operational | Support managers | Weekly | FCR, median resolution time, reopen rate, volume by channel |
| Diagnostic | Team leads, agents | Daily | Queue depth, SLA breach rate, handle time, QA score |

Start by identifying who reads each metric and what decision it drives. If no
one owns the decision triggered by a metric, do not track it yet.

Steps:
1. List current pain points from support team retrospectives
2. Map each pain point to a metric category (satisfaction, operational, quality)
3. Define the measurement method and data source for each metric
4. Assign a DRI and a target for each metric
5. Build the minimal dashboard needed to surface all three tiers

### Measure and improve CSAT - survey design and analysis

**Survey design checklist:**
- Send within 1 hour of ticket close - response rate drops sharply after 24 hours
- Keep to 1-2 questions: the rating plus one optional free-text follow-up
- Use a consistent scale - do not mix 5-star with thumbs up/down across touchpoints
- Personalize the subject line with the agent's name and ticket topic

**Calculation:**
```
CSAT = (4-star + 5-star responses) / total responses * 100
```

**Analysis steps:**
1. Segment by channel, agent, ticket category, and customer tier
2. Tag all 1-2 star responses within 24 hours - look for patterns in verbatim feedback
3. Build a weekly trend chart with 4-week moving average to smooth noise
4. Create a detractor recovery workflow: manager outreach within 24 hours for any 1-star

**Improving response rate:**
- Subject line "How did [Agent Name] do?" outperforms generic phrasing
- Mobile-optimized survey - most customers open on phone
- Remove login requirement - anonymous responses get 2-3x higher response rate

### Implement NPS program - collection and segmentation

**Collection strategy:**
- Send after significant support interactions (not every ticket)
- Trigger rules: send after complex tickets, P1 resolutions, or any escalation closed
- Suppress repeat surveys: do not survey the same customer more than once every 90 days

**Calculation:**
```
NPS = Promoters% - Detractors%

Example: 60% promoters, 15% detractors, 25% passives
NPS = 60 - 15 = 45
```

**Segmentation framework:**

| Segment | Score | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Promoters | 9-10 | Case studies, referral asks, community invites |
| Passives | 7-8 | Identify friction - most at risk of churn on next negative event |
| Detractors | 0-6 | Close-the-loop call within 48 hours; flag to CSM if enterprise tier |

Segment NPS by customer tier, product area, support channel, and account age.
New customers tend to score differently than long-tenured accounts.

### Track and optimize resolution time

**Measurement setup:**
- Track `created_at` to `resolved_at` in your ticketing system
- Report median (p50) and 90th percentile (p90) - averages mask outlier drag
- Exclude pending-customer time from elapsed calculation (clock pauses when waiting on customer)

**SLA framework:**

| Priority | Target Resolution | Alert At |
|---|---|---|
| P1 - Service down | 4 hours | 2 hours |
| P2 - Major feature broken | 24 hours | 16 hours |
| P3 - Minor issue / workaround available | 72 hours | 48 hours |
| P4 - Question / enhancement | 7 days | 5 days |

**Root cause analysis for high resolution time:**
1. Identify the top 10% slowest tickets in a period
2. Tag reasons: awaiting escalation, waiting on engineering, reassigned, unclear ask
3. Quantify each reason as a percentage of slow tickets
4. Prioritize fixes by volume x impact - routing logic and escalation paths are typically top two

> A declining resolution time with a rising reopen rate means agents are closing
> tickets prematurely. Always track both together.

### Measure deflection rate - self-service effectiveness

**Proxy measurement methods** (direct deflection is rarely measurable):

1. **Doc-to-ticket ratio** - Track customers who viewed a help article and then
   submitted a ticket within 30 minutes. Low ratio means effective docs.
2. **Chatbot containment** - % of chatbot sessions that reach resolution without
   escalating to a human. Target 40-60% for most support types.
3. **Search abandonment** - In your help center, track searches that end without
   a page view. High abandonment signals a content gap.
4. **Before/after experiment** - Publish a new article on a common topic, compare
   ticket volume for that topic over the next 30 days vs prior 30 days.

**Improving deflection:**
- Run monthly content gap analysis: top 20 ticket topics vs help center coverage
- Add article links to auto-acknowledgment emails for common categories
- Implement a post-submission deflection prompt: show matching articles after ticket submit

### Analyze support trends - topic clustering and forecasting

**Topic clustering workflow:**
1. Export ticket titles and first customer messages for a 30-90 day window
2. Group tickets by existing tags first - identify gaps where >10% have no tag
3. Use keyword frequency on untagged tickets to surface emerging topics
4. Update your taxonomy - aim for 80%+ of tickets tagged to a specific topic
5. Review top 10 topics weekly; track volume trend, CSAT, and resolution time per topic

**Volume forecasting:**
- Use 12 weeks of weekly ticket volume as baseline
- Apply seasonal adjustment for known events (product launches, billing cycles, holidays)
- 4-week trailing average with +20% buffer as capacity target
- Flag any week where volume exceeds forecast by >30% as an anomaly requiring investigation

**Trend signals to monitor:**
- New topic appearing in top 10 that was not there last month - possible product regression
- CSAT drop on a specific topic without volume change - agent knowledge gap or policy confusion
- Resolution time increase on one channel only - tooling or routing issue

### Build support dashboards - by audience

**Executive dashboard (monthly business review):**

| Panel | Metric | Visualization |
|---|---|---|
| Customer Sentiment | CSAT 12-month trend + NPS | Line chart with benchmark line |
| Efficiency | Cost per ticket, deflection rate | KPI card + trend sparkline |
| Volume | Total contacts by channel | Stacked bar, MoM comparison |
| Highlights | Top 3 topic drivers, worst-performing category | Table |

**Manager dashboard (weekly ops review):**

| Panel | Metric | Visualization |
|---|---|---|
| Volume | Tickets opened/closed, backlog | Area chart |
| Quality | CSAT by channel, reopen rate | Bar chart |
| Speed | Median + p90 resolution time vs SLA | Gauge + trend |
| Team | FCR by agent, QA scores | Table with conditional formatting |

**Agent dashboard (daily view):**
- Personal queue: open tickets, SLA risk, oldest unresolved
- Personal CSAT for last 30 days (not ranked against peers)
- Today's handle time vs personal average

## Gotchas

1. **CSAT surveys sent more than 24 hours after ticket close get response bias** - Surveys sent days after resolution disproportionately capture customers who had extreme experiences (very positive or very negative) because neutral customers have moved on. Automate delivery within 1 hour of ticket close to get a representative sample.

2. **FCR self-reporting by agents inflates the metric** - If agents mark tickets as "resolved first contact" manually, they will mark optimistically. FCR should be measured by the ticketing system based on whether the customer reopened or submitted a new ticket on the same topic within 72 hours, not by agent judgment.

3. **Chatbot containment rate hides frustrated escalation paths** - If customers cannot find the escalation button, your containment rate looks great while your CSAT tanks. Always pair containment rate with a post-deflection CSAT signal (even a thumbs up/down) to distinguish genuinely resolved sessions from abandoned ones.

4. **Normalizing agent CSAT by ticket type requires a large sample** - Comparing agents with statistical significance requires at minimum 30 surveys per agent per segment. Trying to normalize by ticket type with small sample sizes produces rankings that are noise, not signal. Use QA score for coaching with small agent pools instead.

5. **Volume forecasting without seasonality adjustments leads to understaffing** - Applying a flat growth rate to weekly volume ignores known spikes (product launches, billing cycle dates, end-of-fiscal-year surges). Build a seasonal adjustment factor by comparing the same week across prior years before making staffing decisions.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking CSAT average without response rate | A 95% CSAT from 3% response rate is meaningless - response bias distorts the score | Always report response rate alongside CSAT; investigate if below 15% |
| Comparing agent CSAT without normalizing by ticket type | Agents on billing queues outscore agents on complex bug reports by default | Segment CSAT by ticket category before comparing agents; use for coaching only |
| Reporting resolution time as an average | Averages are pulled high by a small number of outliers, masking the typical experience | Use median (p50) as primary; add p90 to surface worst-case |
| Measuring deflection rate from chatbot containment alone | Bots can block escalation paths, yielding high containment and low satisfaction | Pair containment with post-deflection CSAT; 0 escalations + low satisfaction is a false positive |
| Building dashboards without a decision owner | Dashboards created without a defined reviewer become shelfware | Identify the decision each dashboard drives before building; assign a weekly reviewer |
| Chasing benchmark NPS without context | A software company and a logistics provider should not share the same NPS target | Set targets relative to your own historical trend and competitive cohort, not generic benchmarks |
