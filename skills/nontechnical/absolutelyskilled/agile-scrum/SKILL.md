# Agile & Scrum

Agile is an iterative approach to project delivery that focuses on delivering small,
incremental pieces of value through short cycles called sprints. Scrum is the most
widely adopted Agile framework, structured around defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum
Master, Developers), events (Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review,
Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). This skill
covers practical application of Scrum ceremonies, estimation techniques, velocity
tracking, Kanban flow management, and continuous improvement practices.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Needs to plan a sprint or organize a sprint planning session
- Wants to run or improve retrospectives
- Asks about velocity tracking, burndown charts, or sprint metrics
- Needs to estimate stories using story points, T-shirt sizing, or planning poker
- Wants to set up or optimize a Kanban board
- Asks about backlog grooming or refinement practices
- Needs templates for user stories, acceptance criteria, or definition of done
- Wants to improve team agile processes or adopt Scrum

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- General project management unrelated to Agile (waterfall, PRINCE2, etc.)
- Software architecture or technical design decisions (use engineering skills instead)

## Key principles

1. **Deliver working increments** - Every sprint must produce a potentially shippable
   increment. If a team consistently fails to deliver done work, the sprint length or
   scope is wrong. Favor smaller slices of value over large batches.

2. **Inspect and adapt relentlessly** - Every Scrum event is an inspection point.
   Retrospectives are not optional feel-good sessions; they produce concrete action
   items that the team commits to in the next sprint. Measure whether actions were
   completed.

3. **Limit work in progress** - Whether using Scrum or Kanban, WIP limits are the
   single most effective lever for improving flow. A team that starts fewer things
   finishes more things. Default WIP limit: number of developer pairs + 1.

4. **Estimation is for planning, not accountability** - Story points measure
   complexity and uncertainty, not hours or individual performance. Never use velocity
   to compare teams or pressure individuals. Velocity is a planning tool, not a
   performance metric.

5. **Transparency over perfection** - Make all work visible. Hidden work-in-progress,
   undisclosed blockers, and invisible technical debt destroy predictability. A board
   that shows reality is more valuable than one that looks clean.

---

## Core concepts

**Scrum events form a feedback loop.** Sprint Planning sets the goal and selects
work. Daily Standups surface blockers early. Sprint Review demonstrates the increment
to stakeholders. Retrospective improves the process itself. Skipping any event breaks
the feedback loop and causes drift.

**The Product Backlog is a living, ordered list.** It is not a dumping ground for
every idea. The Product Owner continuously refines and re-prioritizes it. Items near
the top are small, well-defined, and estimated. Items at the bottom are large and
vague. Backlog refinement (grooming) should consume roughly 10% of the team's
capacity each sprint.

**Velocity is a trailing indicator.** It is the sum of story points completed in a
sprint. Use the average of the last 3-5 sprints for planning. Velocity naturally
fluctuates; a single sprint's velocity is meaningless. Only trends over 4+ sprints
reveal real changes in capacity or process.

**Kanban focuses on flow, not time-boxes.** Instead of sprints, Kanban uses a
continuous flow with explicit WIP limits per column. The key metrics are cycle time
(how long one item takes from start to done) and throughput (how many items complete
per unit of time). Kanban and Scrum can coexist (Scrumban).

## Common tasks

### Run sprint planning

Sprint planning answers two questions: **What** can we deliver this sprint? **How**
will we deliver it?

**Template: Sprint Planning Agenda (2 hours for a 2-week sprint)**

1. **Review sprint goal** (10 min) - PO proposes a sprint goal tied to a product
   objective. Team discusses feasibility.
2. **Select backlog items** (40 min) - Team pulls items from the top of the refined
   backlog until capacity is reached. Use last 3-sprint velocity average as the guide.
3. **Task breakdown** (50 min) - For each selected item, break it into tasks. If any
   task is larger than 1 day, break it further.
4. **Confirm sprint goal and commitment** (10 min) - Team agrees on the sprint
   backlog and goal. PO confirms priority order.
5. **Identify risks and dependencies** (10 min) - Flag external dependencies, PTO,
   or known blockers.

> Capacity adjustment: multiply velocity by (available dev-days / total dev-days)
> to account for PTO, holidays, and on-call rotations.

### Estimate with story points

Use the modified Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. Anything above 13
should be split before entering a sprint.

**Planning Poker process:**
1. PO reads the user story and acceptance criteria
2. Team asks clarifying questions (time-box: 3 min per story)
3. Everyone simultaneously reveals their estimate
4. If estimates diverge by more than 2 levels (e.g., 3 vs 13), the highest and
   lowest estimators explain their reasoning
5. Re-vote. If still divergent after 2 rounds, take the higher estimate

**Estimation reference table:**

| Points | Complexity | Uncertainty | Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial | None | Fix a typo, update a config value |
| 2 | Low | Minimal | Add a field to an existing form |
| 3 | Moderate | Low | Build a new API endpoint with tests |
| 5 | Significant | Some | Integrate a third-party service |
| 8 | High | Moderate | Redesign a data pipeline component |
| 13 | Very high | High | New feature spanning multiple services |
| 21 | Epic-level | Very high | Should be broken down further |

### Run a retrospective

**Format: Start-Stop-Continue (45 min for a 2-week sprint)**

1. **Set the stage** (5 min) - State the retro goal. Use a safety check (1-5 scale)
   to gauge openness.
2. **Gather data** (15 min) - Each person writes items on sticky notes (or digital
   equivalent) in three columns: Start doing, Stop doing, Continue doing.
3. **Group and vote** (10 min) - Cluster similar items. Dot-vote (3 dots per person)
   to prioritize.
4. **Generate actions** (10 min) - For the top 2-3 voted items, define a specific
   action with an owner and a due date. Actions must be achievable within one sprint.
5. **Close** (5 min) - Review action items. Check: did we complete last retro's
   actions?

**Alternative formats** (rotate to prevent staleness):
- **4Ls**: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
- **Sailboat**: Wind (helps), Anchor (slows), Rocks (risks), Island (goal)
- **Mad-Sad-Glad**: Emotional categorization for team health checks
- **Timeline**: Plot the sprint on a timeline marking highs and lows

> Rule: never leave a retro without exactly 2-3 action items with named owners.
> More than 3 dilutes focus. Zero means the retro was pointless.

### Track velocity and sprint metrics

**Key metrics to track each sprint:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Velocity | Sum of completed story points | Stable +/- 20% over 4 sprints |
| Sprint completion rate | Completed items / committed items | 80-100% |
| Carry-over rate | Incomplete items / committed items | 0-20% |
| Scope change rate | Added items / original committed items | 0-10% |
| Bug ratio | Bugs found / stories delivered | Below 15% |

**Burndown chart interpretation:**
- **Flat line early, cliff late** - Team batching work; encourage smaller slices
- **Scope creep visible** - Line goes up mid-sprint; enforce sprint scope protection
- **Smooth decline** - Healthy flow; team is breaking work well
- **Never reaches zero** - Chronic over-commitment; reduce sprint scope by 20%

### Set up a Kanban board

**Standard columns:**

```
Backlog | Ready | In Progress | In Review | Done
```

**WIP limits by column (for a team of 5):**
- Backlog: unlimited (but keep refined items at top)
- Ready: 8 (roughly 1.5 sprints of work)
- In Progress: 5 (one per developer, adjust for pairing)
- In Review: 3 (force fast feedback loops)
- Done: unlimited

**Kanban policies (make explicit):**
- An item enters "Ready" only when it has acceptance criteria and an estimate
- An item enters "In Progress" only when WIP limit allows
- An item enters "In Review" only when it meets Definition of Done for dev
- Pull from the right: always prioritize finishing items in Review before starting
  new items from Ready

### Write effective user stories

**Template:**
```
As a [type of user],
I want to [action],
so that [benefit/value].
```

**Acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then):**
```
Given [precondition],
When [action is taken],
Then [expected result].
```

**INVEST checklist for good stories:**
- **I**ndependent - No dependencies on other stories in the sprint
- **N**egotiable - Details can be discussed, not locked down
- **V**aluable - Delivers value to the user or business
- **E**stimable - Team can estimate its size
- **S**mall - Fits within one sprint (ideally 1-3 days of work)
- **T**estable - Clear criteria to verify it's done

### Define Definition of Done

A shared checklist that every increment must satisfy before it can be called done.

**Example Definition of Done:**
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one peer
- All acceptance criteria verified
- Unit tests written and passing (minimum 80% coverage for new code)
- Integration tests passing
- No known critical or high-severity bugs
- Documentation updated (API docs, README, changelog)
- Deployed to staging and smoke-tested
- Product Owner has accepted the demo

> The DoD is not negotiable per-story. If the team cannot meet the DoD, the story
> is not done - it carries over. Lowering DoD to "finish" stories creates hidden debt.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Using velocity to compare teams | Different teams estimate differently; points are relative to each team | Use velocity only within a team for sprint planning |
| Skipping retrospectives when "busy" | Removes the only mechanism for process improvement; problems compound | Shorten the retro to 30 min but never skip it |
| Treating story points as hours | Creates pressure to track time, not complexity; gaming behavior follows | Anchor points to reference stories, not time |
| Allowing unlimited WIP | Context-switching kills throughput; nothing gets finished | Set explicit WIP limits and enforce them |
| Sprint scope changes after planning | Destroys predictability and team trust | Only the PO can add items, and only by removing equal-sized items |
| No Definition of Done | "Done" means different things to different people; quality erodes | Write and post DoD visibly; review it quarterly |
| Carrying over 30%+ of sprint work | Indicates chronic over-commitment or poor refinement | Reduce committed scope by 20%; invest more in refinement |
| Retrospective without action items | Venting session with no improvement; team loses faith in the process | Always leave with 2-3 specific, owned, time-bound actions |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Velocity is team-specific and not comparable across teams** - Teams calibrate story points differently. A team doing 40 points per sprint is not twice as productive as one doing 20. Using velocity to compare teams, pressure individuals, or set targets from outside the team destroys the signal. It is a planning tool only.

2. **Adding items mid-sprint breaks the sprint goal** - The sprint goal is a commitment, not a suggestion. Adding new work mid-sprint without removing equivalent work invalidates velocity data and trains the team that commitments are flexible. Only the PO can add items, and only by removing something of equal size.

3. **Retrospectives without named action owners are decoration** - "We should communicate better" is not an action item. Actions without a single owner and a due date will not happen. Every retro must end with 2-3 specific, owned, sprint-scoped actions. Anything else is venting.

4. **Carrying over stories inflates apparent velocity** - If a team regularly carries over 20-30% of committed work and counts it as completed in the next sprint, their velocity is artificially high and sprint planning is unreliable. Track carry-over rate separately and reduce committed scope until completion rate reaches 85%+.

5. **Definition of Done that bends per story creates hidden debt** - Lowering the DoD to "finish" a story (skipping tests, skipping review) creates undisclosed technical debt that surfaces as bugs and rework. The DoD is a floor, not a negotiation. A story that cannot meet the DoD is not done; it carries over.
