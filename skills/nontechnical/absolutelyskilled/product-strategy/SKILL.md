## Key principles

1. **Strategy is about saying no** - A roadmap that includes every request is not a
   strategy, it is a backlog. Every "yes" to one initiative is implicitly "no" to five
   others. The clearest signal of a weak strategy is an inability to decline requests
   from stakeholders with conviction and data.

2. **Outcome-based roadmaps, not feature lists** - Roadmaps organized by features
   (build search, add dark mode, create reports) measure output. Roadmaps organized by
   outcomes (reduce time-to-value by 40%, increase weekly active usage, improve
   onboarding completion) measure impact. Ship outcomes; features are the means, not
   the end.

3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Most teams have 10x more ideas than capacity. The job
   of a product leader is not to find ways to do everything - it is to find the 20%
   of work that delivers 80% of the impact and protect the team's focus on it.

4. **Validate before building** - The most expensive mistake in product is building
   something nobody wants. Every assumption in a roadmap should have a cheapest
   possible test: a landing page, a prototype, a sales call, a survey. Build only after
   validation reduces uncertainty to an acceptable level.

5. **Align product to business goals** - Product teams that operate in isolation from
   business metrics (revenue, retention, activation) eventually lose organizational
   trust and budget. Every major initiative should trace directly to a business outcome
   the company cares about. If you cannot draw the line, reconsider the initiative.

## Core concepts

**Vision / Strategy / Roadmap hierarchy**

- **Vision** is the 3-5 year aspirational destination: "What does the world look like
  if we succeed?" It is qualitative, inspiring, and stable. It changes rarely.
- **Strategy** is the 12-18 month plan for how you get there: which customer segments,
  which problems, which bets. It is directional, not exhaustive.
- **Roadmap** is the quarterly execution plan: which outcomes to drive, which
  initiatives to fund, what ships when. It is concrete and frequently updated.

A common mistake is writing a roadmap without a strategy, or a strategy without a
vision. The hierarchy must exist for prioritization decisions to be defensible.

**Prioritization frameworks**

RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) and ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) are
quantitative scoring models that convert gut-feel debates into structured comparisons.
MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have) is a categorization system
used most often for release scoping. Kano maps features to customer satisfaction curves
to distinguish must-haves from delighters. See `references/prioritization-frameworks.md`
for detailed scoring guides, formulas, and examples.

**Product-market fit signals**

Strong PMF is characterized by: >40% of users saying they would be "very disappointed"
if the product disappeared (Sean Ellis test), high organic/word-of-mouth growth, strong
retention curves that flatten rather than decay to zero, and sales cycles that shorten
as you refine the pitch. Weak PMF shows as: feature-request-driven roadmaps, high churn
despite onboarding improvements, and a sales team that cannot articulate who the
product is for.

**North star metric**

A single metric that best captures the core value your product delivers to customers.
It must be a leading indicator of long-term revenue (not revenue itself), it must be
actionable by the product team, and it must be understandable by everyone in the
company. Examples: Slack (messages sent per user per day), Airbnb (nights booked),
Spotify (time spent listening). Choose one. Two north stars create two competing
roadmaps.

## Common tasks

### Write a product vision statement

A strong vision answers: who are we serving, what problem do we solve, and what does
the world look like when we win?

**Template:**

```
For [target customer], who [has this problem or need],
[Product name] is a [product category] that [key benefit / why it's valuable].
Unlike [primary alternative], our product [key differentiator].
```

**Extended narrative vision (for internal strategy docs):**

```
## Our Vision

In [timeframe], [company/product] will be [aspirational description of the future state].

[Target customers] will [be able to do / experience] [specific outcome] that was
previously impossible or painful.

We will know we have succeeded when [measurable signal]:
- [Signal 1]
- [Signal 2]
- [Signal 3]
```

Good vision statements are short (fits on one slide), memorable (team can recite it),
and opinionated (excludes some customers and use cases intentionally).

### Build an outcome-based roadmap

**Step 1 - Identify themes from strategy**

Map each strategic bet to a roadmap theme. A theme is a broad problem area, not a
feature. Examples: "Reduce time-to-first-value," "Improve team collaboration," "Unlock
enterprise segment."

**Step 2 - Define outcomes per theme**

For each theme, write one measurable outcome: the metric that would move if this theme
is executed well. Outcome = metric + direction + magnitude + timeframe.

Example: "Increase 7-day activation rate from 42% to 60% by Q3."

**Roadmap template:**

| Theme | Outcome target | Key initiatives | Quarter | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Activation | 7-day activation 42% -> 60% | Onboarding redesign, empty state improvements | Q2 | In progress |
| Collaboration | Teams with 3+ active members +30% | Shared workspaces, @ mentions | Q3 | Planned |
| Enterprise | 10 enterprise logos signed | SSO, audit logs, admin dashboard | Q3-Q4 | Discovery |

**Step 3 - Sequence by dependency and impact**

Order themes by: does this unblock something else? If yes, pull it earlier. Then order
remaining themes by expected impact on the north star metric.

---

### Prioritize with RICE, ICE, or MoSCoW

Use RICE for quarterly planning with multiple competing initiatives. Use ICE for rapid
triage of a long backlog. Use MoSCoW for scoping a specific release.

**RICE scoring:**

```
Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

- Reach: how many users affected per quarter (number)
- Impact: 3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low, 0.25 = minimal
- Confidence: 100% = high, 80% = medium, 50% = low
- Effort: person-months required
```

**ICE scoring (faster, less precise):**

```
Score = Impact x Confidence x Ease (each 1-10)
```

**MoSCoW categorization:**

- **Must Have** - release fails without this (legal, core function, blocking user flow)
- **Should Have** - important but not blocking; include if capacity allows
- **Could Have** - nice to have; cut first when scope is tight
- **Won't Have** - explicitly out of scope this cycle (park, do not delete)

For detailed scoring examples and comparison tables, see
`references/prioritization-frameworks.md`.

### Set product OKRs

Product OKRs translate strategy into measurable quarterly commitments.

**Structure:**

```
Objective: [Qualitative, inspiring, directional - no metric]
  KR1: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
  KR2: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
  KR3: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
```

**Rules for strong KRs:**
- Measure outcomes, not outputs ("activation rate increases to 60%" not "ship new
  onboarding flow")
- Baseline must be known before the quarter starts - never set a KR on a metric you
  do not currently measure
- 70% attainment is success; 100% means the target was too conservative
- Max 3 KRs per objective; max 3 objectives per team per quarter

**Common anti-pattern:** Writing KRs as task lists ("Launch feature X," "Complete Y
project"). These are milestones, not results. Rewrite as: "Feature X drives metric M
to level N."

### Create a product strategy document

A one-page product strategy document that stakeholders can read in 5 minutes:

```markdown
## Product Strategy - [Year / Half]

### Context
[1-2 sentences: company stage, market conditions, and what has changed since last cycle]

### Where we play
[Target customer segments and use cases we are optimizing for this period]

### Where we do not play
[Explicit exclusions - segments, use cases, or problems out of scope]

### Strategic bets
1. [Bet 1]: [Hypothesis] - if we do X, we expect Y outcome because Z
2. [Bet 2]: [Hypothesis]
3. [Bet 3]: [Hypothesis]

### Key metrics
- North star: [metric and current baseline]
- Supporting metrics: [2-3 metrics that feed the north star]

### Risks and assumptions
- [Assumption 1] - we will validate by [date] using [method]
- [Assumption 2] - we will validate by [date] using [method]
```

### Make build vs. buy decisions

When evaluating whether to build, buy, or partner for a capability:

| Criterion | Build | Buy | Partner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core differentiator? | Yes | No | No |
| Time to market critical? | No | Yes | Yes |
| Internal expertise exists? | Yes | No | Available externally |
| Long-term maintenance cost | High | Vendor dependent | Shared |
| Customization required? | Full control | Limited | Negotiable |

**Decision heuristic:**
- If the capability is a core differentiator AND you have the expertise: build
- If the capability is commodity AND a mature solution exists: buy
- If speed matters more than control AND a capable partner exists: partner
- Never build what the market commoditizes; never buy what creates lock-in on your
  core differentiator

---

### Communicate roadmap to stakeholders

Different audiences require different roadmap formats.

**For executives:** One-page view. Themes and outcomes only. No feature names. Answers:
"What business problems are we solving and when will we see results?"

**For engineering and design:** Outcome-first with supporting initiatives. Includes
known dependencies, risks, and confidence level. Answers: "What are we building and
why does it matter?"

**For customers:** Public roadmap with near-term themes only. Commitments, not dates.
Avoid feature-level specifics that constrain design. Answers: "Is this team moving in
a direction I trust?"

**For sales and customer success:** Near-term deliverables with anticipated dates.
Include enterprise-specific items. Answers: "What can I promise to prospects this
quarter?"

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Roadmap as a feature wish list | Treats output as success; teams ship but metrics do not move | Reframe each initiative as an outcome with a target metric |
| Prioritizing by loudest stakeholder | Recency and seniority bias override user impact and data | Score every request with RICE or ICE before any commitment |
| Annual roadmap with no updates | Markets change; a frozen roadmap becomes fiction by Q3 | Review and reforecast roadmap quarterly; update stakeholders |
| Skipping discovery to ship faster | Builds the wrong thing faster; sunk cost forces bad decisions | Run a 1-2 week discovery sprint before committing to any major initiative |
| Copying competitor features | Optimizes for the competitor's strategy, not your users | Start with your own user research; competitor features are signals, not specs |
| Treating OKRs as a task list | Measures effort, not impact; creates busywork culture | Write KRs as metric movements, not deliverables; review weekly |

---

## Gotchas

1. **RICE scores treated as absolute truth** - RICE produces a number, but the inputs (Reach, Confidence, Effort) are estimates. Teams often stop debating once the spreadsheet exists. Treat RICE as a structured conversation starter, not a decision oracle - challenge the inputs, not just the outputs.

2. **Vision written for the all-hands, not the team** - Inspirational vision statements that sound good in a company meeting often give zero guidance on what to build. A vision that can't help a PM decline a feature request has failed its job.

3. **OKRs that are actually task lists** - The most common mistake is writing KRs as deliverables ("ship search feature") rather than metric movements. When asked to write OKRs, explicitly check every KR: can you achieve it without the metric moving? If yes, rewrite it.

4. **Roadmap shared at the feature level with executives** - Executives reading feature-level roadmaps immediately start adding items. Share outcomes-only views with execs; reserve feature-level detail for engineering and design.

5. **"Won't Have" items deleted instead of parked** - MoSCoW's Won't Have bucket is a deliberate parking lot. Deleting items means they reappear as new requests next quarter. Always keep the Won't Have list visible and reference it when similar requests arrive.
