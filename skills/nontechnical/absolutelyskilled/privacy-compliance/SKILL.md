# Privacy Compliance

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides engineering and product implementation
> guidance only. It is not legal advice. Consult qualified legal counsel for
> compliance decisions specific to your organization, jurisdiction, and use case.

A practical framework for engineers and product teams building privacy-compliant
systems. Covers GDPR, CCPA, consent management, data subject rights, DPIAs, and
cross-border transfer mechanisms - with emphasis on *what to build* and *how to
structure it*, not just regulatory theory.

---

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:

1. Asks how to implement GDPR or CCPA compliance for a product
2. Needs to design a cookie banner, consent manager, or preference center
3. Wants to conduct or template a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
4. Needs to handle a Subject Access Request (SAR), deletion, or portability request
5. Is writing or reviewing a privacy policy
6. Needs to implement data retention or deletion schedules
7. Is configuring cross-border data transfers (SCCs, adequacy decisions)

Do NOT trigger this skill for:

- General security hardening unrelated to personal data (use the backend-engineering skill)
- IP law, contracts, or employment law - these require specialized legal counsel

---

## Key principles

1. **Privacy by design** - Build privacy controls into the architecture from day
   one. Data minimization, access controls, and audit logs are structural decisions,
   not features added after launch. Retrofitting is expensive and incomplete.

2. **Data minimization** - Collect only what you need, retain it only as long as
   necessary, and delete it on schedule. Every field in your database is a liability
   if you cannot justify its purpose and retention period.

3. **Lawful basis for processing** - Every processing activity must have a documented
   lawful basis (GDPR) or a disclosure obligation (CCPA). "We might need it someday"
   is not a lawful basis. Document the basis before you collect the data.

4. **Transparency** - Users must understand what data you collect, why, how long you
   keep it, and who you share it with. Privacy policies must be readable, not a legal
   wall. Consent must be informed to be valid.

5. **Accountability** - Maintain records of processing activities (RoPA), run DPIAs
   for high-risk processing, appoint a DPO when required, and respond to data subject
   requests within statutory deadlines. Compliance is a continuous process, not a
   one-time audit.

## Core concepts

### GDPR vs CCPA at a glance

| Dimension | GDPR (EU/EEA) | CCPA / CPRA (California) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Any org processing EU/EEA residents' data | Businesses meeting revenue/data thresholds serving CA residents |
| Legal basis required | Yes - 6 lawful bases | No explicit basis required; disclosure + opt-out |
| Consent standard | Freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous, withdrawable | Opt-out for sale/sharing; opt-in for sensitive data (CPRA) |
| Data subject rights | Access, rectification, erasure, portability, restriction, objection, no automated decision | Know, delete, correct, opt-out of sale/sharing, limit sensitive data use, non-discrimination |
| Response deadline | 30 days (extendable to 90 days) | 45 days (extendable to 90 days) |
| Breach notification | 72 hours to supervisory authority; notify individuals if high risk | Reasonable time; private right of action for breaches |
| Penalties | Up to 4% global annual turnover or €20M | Up to $7,500 per intentional violation |
| DPO required | For large-scale systematic processing or sensitive data | No equivalent role required |
| Cross-border transfers | SCCs, adequacy decisions, BCRs required | No equivalent mechanism required |

### Lawful bases for processing (GDPR Art. 6)

| Basis | When to use | Gotcha |
|---|---|---|
| Consent | Marketing, non-essential cookies, optional features | Must be withdrawable; withdrawal must be as easy as giving it |
| Contract | Processing necessary to fulfill a contract with the user | Can only cover what is genuinely necessary for the contract |
| Legal obligation | Tax records, fraud reporting mandated by law | Must be a specific law, not a vague compliance claim |
| Vital interests | Emergency medical situations | Rarely applicable outside health contexts |
| Public task | Government and public authority processing | Not applicable to most private organizations |
| Legitimate interests (LI) | Analytics, fraud prevention, direct marketing (with caveats) | Must pass LI Assessment (LIA) - user interests must not override yours |

### Data subject rights

| Right | GDPR | CCPA/CPRA | Implementation note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Right to know / access | Art. 15 | Yes | Export all personal data in a portable format |
| Right to rectification / correction | Art. 16 | CPRA only | Update incorrect data across all systems |
| Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") | Art. 17 | Yes | Cascade deletes across primary store, replicas, backups, third-party processors |
| Right to portability | Art. 20 | Yes (categories + specific pieces) | Machine-readable format (JSON, CSV) |
| Right to restriction of processing | Art. 18 | No | Freeze processing while dispute is resolved |
| Right to object | Art. 21 | Opt-out of sale/sharing | Especially for direct marketing and LI-based processing |
| No automated decision-making | Art. 22 | No | Human review option for decisions with legal/significant effects |

### Cross-border transfer mechanisms

| Mechanism | Use when |
|---|---|
| Adequacy decision | Transferring to a country the EU Commission has approved (e.g., UK post-IDTA, Japan, Canada) |
| Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) | Most common for transfers to non-adequate countries (e.g., US). Use 2021 SCCs. |
| Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) | Intra-group transfers within a large multinational; requires DPA approval, lengthy process |
| Derogations (Art. 49) | Narrow exceptions: explicit consent, performance of contract, vital interests. Not for systematic transfers. |

## Common tasks

### 1. Implement a GDPR compliance checklist

Use this as a product/engineering launch gate:

**Data inventory**
- [ ] Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) created and up to date
- [ ] Lawful basis documented for each processing activity
- [ ] Retention periods defined for each data category
- [ ] Third-party processors identified; DPAs signed with each

**Technical controls**
- [ ] Personal data encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Access to personal data is role-based and audited
- [ ] Pseudonymization applied where full identification is not needed
- [ ] Automated deletion jobs scheduled per retention policy

**User-facing obligations**
- [ ] Privacy policy published, accessible, and up to date
- [ ] Cookie consent mechanism in place (see task 2)
- [ ] Data subject request workflow implemented (see task 4)
- [ ] Age verification where required (special categories, children's data)

**Organizational**
- [ ] DPO appointed (if required) and contact details published
- [ ] Data breach response procedure documented and tested
- [ ] DPIA completed for high-risk processing activities (see task 3)
- [ ] Staff privacy training completed

---

### 2. Design consent management (cookie banners and preference center)

**The consent bar is higher than most implementations meet.** For GDPR, pre-ticked
boxes, bundled consent, and making "reject" harder than "accept" are all invalid.

**Cookie categories to surface to users:**

| Category | Examples | Requires consent? |
|---|---|---|
| Strictly necessary | Session auth, load balancing, CSRF tokens | No - but must disclose |
| Functional / preferences | Language, theme, remembered settings | Yes (GDPR), disclose (CCPA) |
| Analytics / performance | Google Analytics, Heap, session recording | Yes (GDPR), opt-out (CCPA) |
| Marketing / advertising | Ad pixels, retargeting, cross-site tracking | Yes (GDPR), opt-out of sale (CCPA) |

**Implementation requirements:**

```
Banner must:
- Appear before any non-essential cookies are set
- Present accept and reject options with equal prominence
- Link to full privacy policy and cookie policy
- Allow granular category-level choice (not just accept all / reject all)
- Record consent with timestamp, version, and signal (for audit)

Preference center must:
- Be accessible from footer at any time
- Allow withdrawing consent as easily as giving it
- Persist preferences across sessions (store in first-party cookie or server-side)
- Respect GPC (Global Privacy Control) signal for CCPA opt-out
```

**Consent record schema (minimum):**

```json
{
  "user_id": "...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:23:00Z",
  "policy_version": "2.3",
  "signal": "explicit_accept",
  "categories": {
    "strictly_necessary": true,
    "functional": true,
    "analytics": false,
    "marketing": false
  },
  "geo": "DE",
  "ip_hash": "sha256(...)"
}
```

### 3. Conduct a DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)

A DPIA is mandatory under GDPR Art. 35 when processing is likely to result in a
high risk to individuals. Always required for: systematic profiling, large-scale
sensitive data processing, systematic monitoring of public areas.

**DPIA template:**

```
1. DESCRIPTION OF PROCESSING
   - Purpose(s) of the processing
   - Nature of the processing (collection, storage, sharing, deletion)
   - Scope: data categories, volume, frequency, retention
   - Context: who are the data subjects? Are they vulnerable?
   - Recipients: internal teams, third-party processors, public

2. NECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY
   - Is each data element strictly necessary for the stated purpose?
   - Could a less privacy-invasive approach achieve the same outcome?
   - What is the legal basis? Is it proportionate to the risk?
   - What retention period is justified?

3. RISK IDENTIFICATION
   For each risk, assess: likelihood (Low/Medium/High) x severity (Low/Medium/High)
   - Unauthorized access or data breach
   - Inadvertent disclosure to wrong recipients
   - Excessive collection beyond stated purpose
   - Inability to fulfill data subject rights
   - Re-identification of pseudonymized data
   - Discrimination or unfair automated decisions

4. RISK MITIGATION MEASURES
   - Technical: encryption, access controls, pseudonymization, audit logs
   - Organizational: training, DPAs with processors, incident response plan
   - Process: retention schedules, DSR workflow, breach notification procedure

5. RESIDUAL RISK AND SIGN-OFF
   - Residual risk level after mitigations: Low / Medium / High
   - If residual risk remains High: consult supervisory authority before proceeding
   - Sign-off: DPO (if applicable), Legal, Engineering, Product owner
   - Review date: (recommend annually or on significant change)
```

---

### 4. Handle data subject requests (SAR, deletion, portability)

**Response deadlines:** 30 days (GDPR), 45 days (CCPA), both extendable once by
an additional 30-45 days with notice to the requestor.

**Identity verification:** Verify identity before fulfilling any request. For
authenticated users, session confirmation is sufficient. For unauthenticated
requests, ask for information already held (e.g., email + last 4 of payment card).
Do not ask for more data than needed to verify.

**Request types and implementation:**

```
Subject Access Request (SAR / Right to Know):
- Export all personal data held across: primary DB, data warehouse,
  analytics tools, marketing platforms, support tickets, backups*
- Include: categories of data, purposes, retention periods,
  recipients/third parties, source of data if not collected directly
- Format: machine-readable (JSON/CSV) + human-readable summary
- *Note: you must describe backup data; you are not required to restore
  a backup solely to fulfill a SAR

Erasure / Right to Deletion:
- Delete from primary store, read replicas, analytics, marketing platforms
- Notify all processors and sub-processors
- Exceptions: data held for legal obligation (tax, fraud) may be retained
  with processing restricted; document the exception
- Backups: document policy (e.g., "purged within 90 days as backups rotate")
- Send confirmation to requestor with scope of deletion

Portability (GDPR Art. 20 / CCPA):
- Applies to data the user provided (not inferred data under GDPR)
- Format: structured, commonly used, machine-readable (JSON preferred)
- Must include all user-provided + observed behavioral data

Request tracking minimum fields:
- Request ID, type, date received, requestor identity verified (boolean)
- Date fulfilled / extended / denied, reason if denied, response sent (boolean)
```

### 5. Write a privacy policy

A compliant privacy policy must be concise, transparent, and written in plain
language. Structure it as follows:

| Section | Required content |
|---|---|
| Who we are | Controller identity, DPO contact (if applicable), lead supervisory authority |
| What data we collect | Categories of personal data, sources (direct, third-party, inferred) |
| Why we process it | Purpose for each category, lawful basis (GDPR) or business purpose (CCPA) |
| How long we keep it | Retention period or criteria for each category |
| Who we share it with | Categories of recipients, processors, any sale/sharing for advertising (CCPA) |
| Your rights | List all applicable rights and how to exercise them |
| Cross-border transfers | Mechanisms used if data leaves the jurisdiction |
| Cookies | Summary + link to full cookie policy |
| How to contact us | Email/form for privacy requests, complaint/supervisory authority info |
| Changes | How you notify users of material updates; effective date |

---

### 6. Implement data retention policies

Every data category needs a documented retention schedule enforced by code, not
just policy documents.

**Retention decision framework:**

```
For each table / data category:
1. What is the purpose of this data?
2. Is there a legal minimum retention? (e.g., financial records: 7 years)
3. Is there a legal maximum? (e.g., GDPR's storage limitation principle)
4. When does the retention clock start?
   - Date of collection, last interaction, end of contract, or legal obligation end
5. What deletion action is taken?
   - Hard delete: remove the row entirely
   - Anonymization: replace PII fields with null/hash - retain for analytics
   - Archival: move to cold storage, restricted access, then delete at archive TTL
```

**Enforcement pattern:**

```pseudocode
// Scheduled job (daily or weekly)
function runRetentionPolicy():
    for each retention_rule in retention_schedule:
        records = db.query(
            "SELECT id FROM " + rule.table +
            " WHERE " + rule.clock_column + " < NOW() - INTERVAL '" + rule.period + "'" +
            " AND NOT has_legal_hold"
        )
        for each record in records:
            if rule.action == "delete":
                db.hardDelete(rule.table, record.id)
                auditLog("retention_delete", rule.table, record.id)
            else if rule.action == "anonymize":
                db.anonymize(rule.table, record.id, rule.pii_columns)
                auditLog("retention_anonymize", rule.table, record.id)
```

---

### 7. Manage cross-border data transfers

**Decision tree:**

```
Is the destination country on the EU adequacy list?
  YES -> Transfer permitted. No additional mechanism required.
        (Maintain documentation confirming adequacy status.)
  NO  -> Is it an intra-group transfer?
    YES -> Consider Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
           - Long approval process; only viable for large multinationals
    NO  -> Use Standard Contractual Clauses (2021 SCCs)
           - Use Module 1 (controller to controller)
           - Use Module 2 (controller to processor) - most common
           - Conduct Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) for high-risk destinations
           - Implement supplementary measures if TIA shows elevated risk
             (e.g., encryption where processor cannot access keys)
```

**Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) - key questions:**
- Does the destination country have laws enabling government access to data?
- What is the legal remedy available to EU individuals?
- What supplementary technical measures would reduce the risk (e.g., end-to-end
  encryption, pseudonymization, data minimization before transfer)?

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Dark patterns in consent (pre-ticked boxes, hidden reject button) | Invalid consent under GDPR; FTC/CCPA enforcement risk | Equal prominence for accept/reject; no pre-ticked boxes; granular controls |
| Collecting data "just in case we need it later" | Violates data minimization; every field is liability; no lawful basis | Define purpose before collection; if no purpose, do not collect |
| Treating privacy policy as a legal shield, not a user document | Users don't read walls of legalese; regulators notice | Write in plain language; use headers, tables, and short sentences |
| Forgetting processors in deletion flows | Erasure obligation extends to all processors; incomplete deletion is non-compliant | Maintain processor inventory; trigger deletion notifications via API or DPA process |
| No retention schedule or "keep forever" default | Breaches storage limitation principle; increases breach impact | Every data category needs a retention period; automate deletion |
| Skipping DPIA for "obviously low-risk" processing | Regulators and courts do not accept this; DPIA is mandatory for defined categories | Run DPIA for any processing involving profiling, sensitive data, or systematic monitoring |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Consent banners that fire after analytics scripts have already loaded are non-compliant** - A common implementation mistake is loading Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, or Heap in the `<head>` before the consent banner renders. By the time the user sees the banner, non-essential cookies have already been set. Load analytics scripts conditionally: fire them only after consent is granted, not before the banner resolves.

2. **Deletion requests must cascade to all processors and data warehouses, not just the primary DB** - Deleting a user from your application database while leaving their data in Segment, BigQuery, Amplitude, Intercom, and your email platform is not compliant with GDPR Art. 17. Maintain a processor inventory and build a deletion workflow that triggers deletion across every system in the chain.

3. **Legitimate Interests as a catch-all basis for analytics is high-risk** - Many companies use "Legitimate Interests" for all analytics because it avoids requiring consent. But LI requires a genuine balancing test (Legitimate Interests Assessment) where user interests do not override yours. Regulators have repeatedly ruled that behavioral analytics for marketing cannot rely on LI and require explicit consent. Default to consent for analytics; use LI only for fraud prevention and security logging.

4. **Breach notification to supervisory authority must happen within 72 hours of becoming aware** - The GDPR 72-hour clock starts when your organization has reasonable certainty that a breach occurred - not when the forensic investigation is complete. You can submit an initial notification with incomplete information and supplement it later. Many organizations fail this deadline by waiting for full confirmation.

5. **Standard Contractual Clauses must be the 2021 version, not the 2010 version** - The EU Commission invalidated the 2010 SCCs in 2021. Any Data Processing Agreement or data transfer mechanism signed before June 2021 that uses the old SCCs must have been updated by December 2022. Using legacy SCCs is a compliance gap that regulators flag in audits. Always use the 2021 SCCs with the correct module (controller-to-processor = Module 2).
