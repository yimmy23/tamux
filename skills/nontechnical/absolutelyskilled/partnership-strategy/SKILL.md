# Partnership Strategy

Partnership strategy is the discipline of designing, launching, and scaling
mutually beneficial relationships between companies to drive growth that neither
could achieve alone. It spans four major pillars: co-marketing (joint campaigns
and content), technology integrations (building product connections), channel
partnerships (resellers, distributors, and VARs), and affiliate programs
(commission-based referral networks). Effective partnership strategy requires
balancing short-term revenue goals with long-term ecosystem value.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Wants to design a co-marketing campaign with another company
- Needs to structure a technology integration partnership
- Asks about building a channel partner or reseller program
- Wants to launch or optimize an affiliate/referral program
- Needs a partner evaluation framework or scorecard
- Asks about partner enablement, onboarding, or portal design
- Wants to structure revenue-sharing or commission models
- Needs a joint go-to-market (GTM) plan with a partner

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Internal sales strategy with no partner involvement - use a sales skill
- Pure product integration architecture without a business relationship - use an API design or system design skill

## Key principles

1. **Mutual value or no deal** - Every partnership must create clear, measurable
   value for both sides. If the value flows only one direction, the partnership
   will collapse within two quarters. Map each partner's incentives explicitly
   before signing anything.

2. **Start narrow, expand on proof** - Launch with one joint activity (a single
   co-marketing campaign, one integration, a pilot channel program) and measure
   results before scaling. Broad partnerships with vague scope produce zero
   outcomes.

3. **Operationalize everything** - A partnership without a shared project plan,
   named owners, regular check-ins, and tracked KPIs is just a press release.
   Treat partner programs with the same operational rigor as internal product
   launches.

4. **Align on ICP overlap** - The strongest partnerships serve the same ideal
   customer profile (ICP) from different angles. If your ICPs don't overlap by
   at least 60%, the partnership will produce low-quality leads and frustrated
   sales teams on both sides.

5. **Protect the brand asymmetrically** - Your partner's reputation becomes yours
   and vice versa. Vet partners thoroughly. Define brand usage guidelines upfront.
   One bad partner experience can damage trust with hundreds of your customers.

## Core concepts

### Partnership types spectrum

| Type | Revenue model | Effort | Timeline to ROI |
|------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Co-marketing | Shared leads, shared costs | Low-medium | 1-3 months |
| Technology integration | Usage-driven revenue, product stickiness | High | 3-6 months |
| Channel/reseller | Revenue share (20-40% typical) | High | 6-12 months |
| Affiliate/referral | Commission per sale (5-30% typical) | Low | 1-3 months |
| Strategic/OEM | Licensing, bundling | Very high | 6-18 months |

### The partner lifecycle

Partners move through five stages: **Identify** (find potential partners via ICP
overlap analysis) -> **Evaluate** (score fit using a partner scorecard) ->
**Activate** (sign agreement, run first joint activity) -> **Scale** (expand
programs, deepen integration) -> **Optimize** (review performance, renegotiate
terms, or sunset). Most failed partnerships skip the Evaluate stage.

### Partner tiers

Mature programs use a tiered structure to allocate resources proportionally:

- **Strategic** (top 3-5 partners) - Dedicated partner manager, joint roadmap,
  executive sponsor, co-selling motion
- **Growth** (10-20 partners) - Shared partner manager, quarterly business
  reviews, co-marketing campaigns
- **Ecosystem** (unlimited) - Self-serve portal, automated onboarding,
  marketplace listing, affiliate commissions

---

## Common tasks

### 1. Evaluate a potential partner

Use a weighted scorecard to avoid gut-feel decisions.

**Partner evaluation scorecard:**

```
Category                    Weight   Score (1-5)   Weighted
----------------------------------------------------------
ICP overlap                 25%      ___           ___
Product complementarity     20%      ___           ___
Market reach / audience     15%      ___           ___
Brand reputation            15%      ___           ___
Technical readiness         10%      ___           ___
Executive sponsorship       10%      ___           ___
Cultural alignment          5%       ___           ___
----------------------------------------------------------
Total                       100%                   ___/5.0

Threshold: >= 3.5 = pursue, 2.5-3.4 = conditional, < 2.5 = pass
```

> Never skip the ICP overlap analysis. It's the single strongest predictor of
> partnership success.

### 2. Design a co-marketing campaign

**Joint campaign planning template:**

```
Campaign name: [Descriptive name]
Partners: [Company A] x [Company B]
Objective: [Shared goal - e.g., generate 500 MQLs each]
Target audience: [Shared ICP description]
Campaign type: [Webinar | eBook | Event | Integration launch]

Responsibilities:
  Company A: [Content creation, landing page, paid promo]
  Company B: [Speaker, email list, social amplification]

Lead sharing:
  - All registrants shared with both parties
  - Leads scored by [criteria] before handoff to sales
  - No cold outreach to partner's existing customers

Timeline:
  Week 1-2: Content creation and review
  Week 3: Landing page live, promotion begins
  Week 4: Event / launch
  Week 5-6: Follow-up nurture sequence

Success metrics:
  - Registrations: [target]
  - Attendance rate: [target, benchmark 40-50% for webinars]
  - MQLs generated per side: [target]
  - Pipeline influenced: [target dollar amount]
```

### 3. Structure a technology integration partnership

**Integration partnership framework:**

```
Integration type: [API | Marketplace | Native | Embedded]
Value to our users: [What problem does this solve?]
Value to partner's users: [What problem does this solve?]

Technical scope:
  - Data flow: [One-way | Bidirectional]
  - Auth method: [OAuth 2.0 | API key | Webhook]
  - Maintenance owner: [Who updates when APIs change?]

Business terms:
  - Revenue model: [Free | Revenue share | Referral fee]
  - Exclusivity: [None | Category exclusive | Time-limited]
  - Joint roadmap cadence: [Quarterly sync]

Go-to-market:
  - Launch announcement: [Blog post, email, social]
  - Documentation: [Joint setup guide]
  - Marketplace listing: [Description, screenshots, install flow]
```

> Always define who owns maintenance when APIs change. This is the number one
> cause of integration partnership disputes.

### 4. Build a channel partner program

**Channel program structure:**

```
Program tiers:
  Registered  - Free, self-serve signup, 10% discount on resale
  Silver      - $10K annual commitment, 20% margin, deal registration
  Gold        - $50K annual commitment, 30% margin, dedicated support, co-selling
  Platinum    - $200K+ annual commitment, 35-40% margin, joint business plan

Partner requirements per tier:
  - Certified sales reps: [1 | 2 | 5 | 10]
  - Certified technical staff: [0 | 1 | 3 | 5]
  - Quarterly revenue minimum: [none | $25K | $100K | $250K]
  - Customer satisfaction score: [none | none | 4.0+ | 4.5+]

Enablement provided:
  - Sales playbook and battle cards
  - Demo environment access
  - Lead sharing from inbound leads in partner's territory
  - Partner portal with deal registration, training, and collateral
  - MDF (Market Development Funds) at Gold+ tiers
```

### 5. Launch an affiliate program

**Affiliate program design:**

```
Commission structure:
  - First sale: [20-30% of first payment]
  - Recurring: [10-20% for 12 months | lifetime]
  - Bonus tiers: [5+ sales/month = 5% bump]
  - Cookie duration: [30 | 60 | 90 days]

Attribution model: [Last click | First click | Multi-touch]

Affiliate tiers:
  Standard    - Self-serve signup, standard commission
  Preferred   - Application-based, higher commission, early access
  Ambassador  - Invite-only, custom terms, co-creation opportunities

Tooling:
  - Tracking platform: [PartnerStack | Impact | FirstPromoter | Custom]
  - Creative assets: banners, email swipes, social copy, landing pages
  - Reporting dashboard: real-time commissions, clicks, conversions

Fraud prevention:
  - Minimum payout threshold: [$50-100]
  - Review window before payout: [30 days]
  - Prohibited: self-referrals, coupon sites (unless approved), brand bidding
  - Clawback clause for refunds within [30-60] days
```

### 6. Create a joint go-to-market plan

**Joint GTM template:**

```
Partners: [Company A] x [Company B]
Joint value proposition: [One sentence - what can customers do now
  that they couldn't before?]

Target accounts: [Named account list or ICP criteria]

GTM motions:
  1. Co-selling: Sales teams intro each other into active deals
  2. Co-marketing: [2-4 joint campaigns per quarter]
  3. Product: Integration featured in onboarding flow
  4. Customer success: Joint QBRs for shared customers

Revenue tracking:
  - Partner-sourced: Partner brought the lead
  - Partner-influenced: Partner helped close an existing lead
  - Attribution via: [UTM parameters | deal registration | CRM field]

Cadence:
  - Weekly: Slack channel for deal-level collaboration
  - Monthly: Partner manager sync (pipeline review)
  - Quarterly: Executive business review (QBR)
  - Annually: Joint planning session (goals, budgets, programs)
```

### 7. Design partner enablement and onboarding

**Partner onboarding sequence (first 30 days):**

```
Day 1-3:   Welcome email + portal access + program guide
Day 3-7:   Sales certification (online, self-paced, 2-hour module)
Day 7-14:  Technical certification (hands-on lab, 4-hour module)
Day 14-21: First joint call with partner manager (pipeline review)
Day 21-30: First co-selling opportunity or co-marketing activity

Enablement assets to prepare:
  - Partner sales playbook (ICP, objection handling, pricing)
  - Battle cards vs. competitors
  - Demo environment with sample data
  - Case studies featuring partner-sourced deals
  - Branded collateral templates (co-brandable)
  - Integration setup guide (if technical partnership)
```

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Signing partners without ICP overlap analysis | Produces zero-quality leads, wastes both teams' time | Score ICP overlap before any agreement; require >= 60% overlap |
| "Partnership" with no shared KPIs | No accountability, relationship drifts to inactivity | Define 3-5 joint KPIs at kickoff; review monthly |
| Launching all partnership types at once | Spreads resources thin, nothing reaches critical mass | Pick one type, prove ROI, then expand |
| Offering the same terms to all partners | Over-invests in low performers, under-invests in top ones | Use a tiered structure with escalating benefits and requirements |
| No deal registration system for channel | Channel conflict and double-commissioning | Implement deal registration with approval workflow from day one |
| Affiliate program with no fraud controls | Coupon stuffing, self-referrals, brand bidding drain budget | Set cookie limits, review periods, prohibited tactics, clawback clauses |

---

## Gotchas

1. **"Partner" and "integration partner" are completely different contractual relationships** - A technology integration can go live with no contract, no revenue sharing, and no co-marketing. But calling it a "partnership" internally creates expectations of joint pipeline, shared KPIs, and dedicated resources that never materialize. Distinguish clearly: integration (technical), referral (commercial), and strategic (joint GTM) - each needs a different agreement and operational model.

2. **Lead sharing without a no-compete clause causes channel conflict** - When a co-marketing campaign generates leads and both sales teams call the same prospect the same week with conflicting positioning and pricing, the prospect loses confidence in both vendors. Define lead ownership, territory, and sequencing in writing before the first campaign launches.

3. **Affiliate fraud is systematic, not occasional** - Without clawback clauses, cookie stuffing detection, and self-referral controls, well-funded bad actors will generate fake signups at scale. First-party fraud (affiliate signs up themselves using referral link) and coupon site abuse can consume 20-40% of affiliate payouts before you notice. Build fraud controls into the program design, not as a post-launch patch.

4. **Partner portals built without self-serve onboarding stall at activation** - A portal that requires a human to approve access, manually create accounts, or send welcome emails creates bottlenecks that prevent the Ecosystem tier from scaling. Partners who wait more than 48 hours for access rarely activate. Build fully automated self-serve onboarding as a launch requirement, not a phase-two feature.

5. **QBRs without pre-shared data produce defensive conversations, not alignment** - Arriving at a quarterly business review without sending pipeline data, co-marketing metrics, and KPI performance to the partner 48 hours in advance turns the meeting into a data-gathering session instead of a strategic review. Send the data package in advance and use the meeting to discuss implications and next quarter's plan.

Only load a references file if the current task requires it - they are long and
will consume context.
