# Financial Reporting

Financial reporting is the structured communication of a company's financial
performance and position to stakeholders - from the board of directors to
external investors. Done well, it builds trust, enables better decisions, and
surfaces problems early. Done poorly, it creates confusion, erodes credibility,
and obscures the actual health of the business.

This skill covers the three core financial statements, how to structure board
and investor presentations, how to build KPI dashboards that match the audience,
and how to write management commentary that tells the story behind the numbers.

---

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks to prepare or review a P&L (income statement) for any period
- Needs to build or explain a balance sheet
- Wants to produce a cash flow statement (direct or indirect method)
- Is building a board deck or board pack for a leadership meeting
- Needs to create a KPI dashboard for executives, investors, or operators
- Wants to write management commentary or MD&A (management discussion and analysis)
- Is preparing an investor update, fundraising narrative, or LP report
- Needs guidance on reporting cadence, materiality thresholds, or GAAP vs IFRS

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Tax preparation or tax strategy (different regulatory domain - involves tax law)
- Audit procedures (auditor independence and audit standards are a separate discipline)

---

## Key principles

1. **Accuracy over aesthetics** - A beautiful deck with wrong numbers destroys
   credibility. Reconcile every figure back to source data before formatting.
   Numbers must tie across all reports in the same package.

2. **Audience-first framing** - A board wants strategic signals and exception
   reporting. Operators want line-level variance details. Investors want growth
   and unit economics. Shape the same underlying data to the reader's decisions.

3. **Variance always needs context** - Never present a number without comparing
   it to budget, prior period, or forecast. The delta tells the story; the
   explanation of the delta tells the business story.

4. **Materiality discipline** - Not every line item deserves equal attention.
   Apply materiality thresholds (typically 5% of revenue or net income) to focus
   commentary on what actually matters to the decision being made.

5. **Consistency enables trust** - Use the same definitions, the same
   calculation methodology, and the same chart formats every period. Changing
   how you define gross margin mid-year, without explicit disclosure, signals
   something is being hidden.

## Core concepts

### The three financial statements and how they connect

**Income Statement (P&L)** - Measures performance over a period. Shows revenue,
cost of goods sold, gross profit, operating expenses, EBITDA, and net income.
The bottom line (net income) flows into retained earnings on the balance sheet.

**Balance Sheet** - A snapshot of what the company owns (assets), owes
(liabilities), and what's left for owners (equity) at a single point in time.
The fundamental equation: `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`. Retained earnings
accumulates all past net income minus dividends.

**Cash Flow Statement** - Explains the change in the cash balance between two
balance sheet dates. Divided into three sections: operating (cash from running
the business), investing (capex, acquisitions), and financing (debt, equity).
Net income is not cash flow - the bridge between them is the operating section.

**How they connect:**
- Net income (P&L) -> increases retained earnings (balance sheet equity)
- Changes in working capital (balance sheet) -> appear in operating cash flow
- Depreciation (P&L non-cash expense) -> added back in operating cash flow
- Cash on the cash flow statement must equal cash on the balance sheet

### GAAP vs IFRS basics

| Dimension | US GAAP | IFRS |
|---|---|---|
| Authority | FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) | IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) |
| Used in | United States | 140+ countries including EU, UK, Australia |
| Revenue recognition | ASC 606 (5-step model) | IFRS 15 (similar, some differences in licenses) |
| Inventory | LIFO permitted | LIFO prohibited |
| Development costs | Expensed as incurred | Capitalized when technically feasible |
| Presentation | More prescriptive | More principles-based |

For most startup and growth-stage reporting, the practical differences are minor.
Flag the accounting standard being used on every financial package.

### Reporting cadence

| Audience | Cadence | Depth |
|---|---|---|
| Board of directors | Monthly or quarterly | High-level KPIs + exceptions + forward-looking |
| Investors (VC/PE) | Monthly (early stage), quarterly (growth) | MRR/ARR, burn, runway, key metrics |
| Management team | Weekly or monthly | Full P&L + operational KPIs |
| External (public company) | Quarterly + annual (10-Q, 10-K) | Full audited statements + MD&A |

### Materiality

A misstatement or omission is material if it would reasonably influence the
decisions of a user of the financial statements. Practical thresholds:
- **5% of revenue** - common threshold for P&L line items
- **0.5% of total assets** - common for balance sheet items
- **Qualitative materiality** - even a small dollar amount is material if it
  involves fraud, regulatory breach, or related-party transactions

## Common tasks

### 1. Prepare a P&L statement

**Structure (top-down):**

```
Revenue
  - Product revenue
  - Services revenue
  = Total revenue

Cost of Revenue (COGS)
  - Direct materials / hosting / fulfillment
  = Gross Profit
  Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Revenue

Operating Expenses
  - Sales & Marketing
  - Research & Development
  - General & Administrative
  = Total OpEx

  = EBITDA  (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortization)
  - Depreciation & Amortization
  = EBIT (Operating Income)
  - Interest expense / income
  - Tax provision
  = Net Income
```

**Process:**
1. Pull actuals from the GL (general ledger) for the period
2. Map GL accounts to report line items using a chart of accounts mapping
3. Populate budget and prior period columns for comparison
4. Calculate variances ($ and %) for every line
5. Flag variances exceeding materiality threshold for commentary

### 2. Prepare a balance sheet

**Structure:**

```
ASSETS
  Current Assets
    - Cash & equivalents
    - Accounts receivable (net of allowances)
    - Prepaid expenses & other current
  Non-Current Assets
    - Property, plant & equipment (net)
    - Intangibles & goodwill
    - Other long-term assets
  = Total Assets

LIABILITIES
  Current Liabilities
    - Accounts payable
    - Accrued liabilities
    - Deferred revenue
    - Current portion of long-term debt
  Non-Current Liabilities
    - Long-term debt
    - Other non-current liabilities
  = Total Liabilities

EQUITY
  - Common stock & additional paid-in capital
  - Retained earnings (accumulated deficit)
  = Total Equity

Total Liabilities + Equity must equal Total Assets (the check)
```

**Verification:** Always confirm the balance sheet balances before distributing.
A balance sheet that doesn't balance indicates a posting error in the GL.

### 3. Prepare a cash flow statement - indirect method

The indirect method starts from net income and adjusts for non-cash items and
working capital changes. It is the most common format for management reporting.

```
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
  Net Income
  + Depreciation & amortization          (non-cash add-back)
  + Stock-based compensation              (non-cash add-back)
  - Increase in accounts receivable       (use of cash)
  + Increase in accounts payable          (source of cash)
  + Increase in deferred revenue          (source of cash)
  - Decrease in accrued liabilities       (use of cash)
  = Net Cash from Operating Activities

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
  - Capital expenditures
  - Acquisitions (net of cash acquired)
  + Proceeds from asset sales
  = Net Cash from Investing Activities

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
  + Proceeds from debt
  - Debt repayments
  + Proceeds from equity issuance
  - Dividends paid
  = Net Cash from Financing Activities

Net Change in Cash = Operating + Investing + Financing
Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Change in Cash
(Ending cash must tie to balance sheet cash)
```

### 4. Build a board deck - structure

Load `references/board-deck-template.md` for the full slide-by-slide guide.

**Core sections every board deck needs:**
1. Executive summary - one slide, key metrics and narrative in 60 seconds
2. Financial performance - P&L vs budget, cash position, runway
3. Key metrics - 3-5 KPIs with trend lines
4. Business updates - wins, risks, key decisions needed
5. Outlook - updated forecast and assumptions

Keep the deck to 10-15 slides. Appendix for deep-dives. Board members read
ahead; the meeting is for discussion, not recitation of slides.

### 5. Create KPI dashboards - metrics by audience

**For the board / investors:**
- ARR or MRR (with growth rate)
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR) or Net Dollar Retention
- Gross margin %
- Burn rate and runway (months)
- Headcount and headcount efficiency (ARR per employee)

**For the CEO / management team:**
- All board metrics plus operating KPIs
- Pipeline coverage and win rate
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and LTV:CAC ratio
- Churn rate (logo and dollar)
- Product usage / activation metrics

**For operators / department heads:**
- Department-level P&L
- Team-specific OKRs and leading indicators
- Budget vs actual by cost center
- Hiring plan vs actuals

Dashboard design rules:
- One primary metric per section, supporting metrics beneath it
- Always show the trend, not just the point-in-time value
- Color code red/amber/green against target, with consistent thresholds
- Include the period and the data source on every chart

### 6. Write management commentary

Management commentary (also called MD&A in public filings) explains the numbers
in plain language. Structure each section as:

1. **What happened** - State the metric and its value vs comparison period
2. **Why it happened** - The 1-3 drivers, quantified where possible
3. **What we're doing about it** - Actions taken or planned (for misses)

**Example (revenue section):**
> "Revenue of $4.2M in Q3 was $380K (10%) above budget, driven primarily by
> the early close of the Acme Enterprise deal ($220K) and stronger SMB cohort
> performance than modeled. The outperformance is partially offset by a $90K
> slip of the Globex renewal into Q4. We expect Q4 to benefit from Globex
> closing plus the newly-signed reseller agreement activated in October."

Avoid hedge words ("somewhat", "relatively", "challenging environment") that
signal the author doesn't understand the numbers.

### 7. Prepare investor updates

Investor updates (monthly or quarterly) should be concise and consistent.
Standard structure:

- **Headline metric** - ARR/MRR, growth rate, one-line narrative
- **Highlights** - 3-5 wins (named deals, product launches, hires)
- **Lowlights** - 2-3 honest problem areas. Investors notice if there are none.
- **Key metrics table** - Same metrics every period (MRR, ARR, churn, burn,
  runway, headcount)
- **Asks** - Specific, actionable requests for introductions or help
- **Financials** - P&L summary and cash position

Keep investor updates under two pages / 10 slides. Frequency builds trust;
detail builds confusion.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Non-GAAP metrics without reconciliation | Hiding GAAP losses behind adjusted EBITDA without showing the bridge erodes credibility with sophisticated investors | Always show the GAAP figure first, then reconcile to non-GAAP with each adjustment labeled |
| Changing metric definitions silently | Restating how gross margin is calculated without disclosure makes prior periods incomparable and looks like manipulation | Document all metric definitions in a "Definitions" appendix and disclose any methodology changes with a restatement |
| Presenting revenue without cohort context | Headline ARR growth can mask deteriorating retention - new logo growth covering up churn | Pair ARR with NRR and a cohort waterfall chart to show expansion vs contraction vs churn |
| Cash flow from operations confused with EBITDA | Companies present EBITDA as a proxy for cash generation but ignore working capital changes, capex, and debt service | Report free cash flow (Operating CF minus capex) alongside EBITDA and explain the bridge |
| Forecast always equals last month plus a constant | Straight-line forecasts ignore pipeline, seasonality, and known events and are not credible | Build forecasts from bottom-up: open pipeline by close probability + renewal base + expansion assumptions |
| Balance sheet omitted from board packs | Focusing only on the P&L misses cash conversion problems, rising payables, and covenant issues | Include a one-page balance sheet summary with working capital metrics in every board pack |

## Gotchas

1. **Net income does not equal cash flow - profitable companies run out of cash** - A company can show strong net income while burning cash due to rising receivables, prepaid expenses, or inventory buildup. The cash flow statement's operating section is the only way to understand actual cash generation. Never report P&L to a board without also reporting cash position and runway.

2. **Non-GAAP metrics without a clear reconciliation to GAAP erode investor trust** - Presenting "Adjusted EBITDA" without showing the bridge from GAAP net income signals to sophisticated investors that GAAP results are being obscured. Always present GAAP first, then reconcile each adjustment line by line with a label.

3. **Changing gross margin definition mid-year makes prior periods incomparable** - If you reclassify customer success headcount from COGS to operating expenses, your gross margin improves immediately with no change in the business. Without explicit disclosure and restatement of prior periods, this looks like performance improvement when it is accounting reclassification.

4. **Deferred revenue on the balance sheet is a liability, not cash equivalence** - Deferred revenue (prepaid contracts not yet earned) shows up as a current liability. A growing deferred revenue balance is a positive signal (customers paying upfront), but it must be earned through service delivery. Never confuse deferred revenue balance with available cash.

5. **Board decks that contain only highlights, no lowlights, destroy credibility** - Experienced board members and investors expect problems in every business. A deck with only wins signals that management is either unaware of issues or hiding them. Proactively identify 2-3 honest problem areas and the mitigation plan in every board pack.
