# Knowledge Base

A knowledge base is a self-service library of structured content that allows users to
find answers without contacting support. Done well, it deflects tickets, reduces support
cost, and builds user confidence. Done poorly, it becomes a graveyard of outdated articles
that users stop trusting. This skill covers the full lifecycle: designing an information
architecture that mirrors how users think, writing articles that scan instead of demand
reading, optimizing search so the right article surfaces on the first try, measuring
deflection to prove business value, and maintaining content ruthlessly so it stays accurate.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Needs to design or restructure a help center or knowledge base taxonomy
- Wants to write, improve, or template a support article (how-to, troubleshooting, FAQ, reference)
- Is optimizing help center search - keywords, synonyms, metadata, or article titles
- Wants to measure deflection rate or build a content health dashboard
- Needs to implement in-product contextual help or tooltip copy
- Is building or refining an article maintenance workflow or content review cadence
- Wants to create article templates by type (how-to, troubleshooting, FAQ, reference)
- Needs to audit existing knowledge base content for gaps or staleness

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Writing internal engineering runbooks or operational playbooks (use incident-management skill)
- Writing API documentation or developer docs (use technical-writing or developer-experience skill)

---

## Key principles

1. **Write for scanning, not reading** - Users arrive with a specific problem and scan
   for the answer. Use short paragraphs, numbered steps, bold key terms, and clear
   headings. A wall of prose is an article no one reads. Every section should be
   findable with a 2-second scan.

2. **Structure mirrors the user's mental model** - Organize content around tasks users
   are trying to complete and problems they experience, not around your product's
   internal feature structure. "How do I invite a teammate?" beats "User Management >
   Invitations > Creating Invitations." Users think in outcomes, not menus.

3. **Search is the primary navigation** - Most users will never browse your category
   tree. They will type a query and click the first plausible result. Every article
   title, summary, and keyword set must be optimized for the words users actually type,
   not the words your product team uses internally.

4. **Measure deflection, not pageviews** - Pageviews tell you what people look at.
   Deflection tells you whether it worked. Track ticket volume versus help center
   traffic, article ratings, failed searches, and contact-us clicks post-article-view.
   A high-traffic article with a high contact-us rate is a failing article.

5. **Maintain ruthlessly** - An outdated article is worse than no article. It creates
   false confidence and support tickets filled with "I followed the article and it
   didn't work." Every article needs an owner, a review date, and a clear process for
   marking it outdated or archiving it when the feature changes.

## Core concepts

### Information architecture

Information architecture (IA) is how content is organized, labeled, and linked. A good
IA means users can find answers in two clicks or fewer from the help center home page.

**Taxonomy design principles:**

- Top-level categories map to user goals, not product features
- 5-8 top-level categories is the practical maximum before navigation becomes overwhelming
- Each article belongs to exactly one primary category (cross-links are fine; dual-homing creates maintenance debt)
- Category names use plain language: "Billing & Payments" beats "Revenue Operations"
- Sub-categories add one level of specificity - avoid nesting beyond two levels

**Taxonomy validation test:** Show the category structure to five users who have never
seen it. Ask them where they would look for a specific common task. If fewer than four
out of five find the right category, redesign the labels.

### Article types

| Type | Purpose | Primary user intent |
|---|---|---|
| How-to | Step-by-step instructions for a task | "I want to do X" |
| Troubleshooting | Diagnose and fix a specific error or symptom | "X is broken or not working" |
| FAQ | Short answers to common questions | "I have a quick question about X" |
| Reference | Complete spec, options table, or glossary | "I need to know all the values/settings for X" |
| Concept | Explains a feature or workflow at a high level | "I want to understand how X works before I use it" |

Most articles should be how-to or troubleshooting. If your knowledge base is mostly
concept articles, users are not finding actionable answers - they are being educated
when they want to be unblocked.

### Search optimization

Search in a knowledge base is keyword-matching plus ranking, not semantic understanding
(even with AI-powered search, explicit optimization still wins).

**The three-layer keyword strategy:**

```
Layer 1 - Title keywords:  Words users type when they know what they want
                           ("reset password", "cancel subscription", "export CSV")

Layer 2 - Synonyms:        Alternate terms for the same concept
                           ("reset" = "forgot", "change", "recover")
                           ("cancel" = "delete account", "close account", "unsubscribe")

Layer 3 - Error strings:   Exact error messages users copy-paste into search
                           ("Error 403: Forbidden", "SMTP authentication failed")
```

Store synonyms in your search tool's synonym dictionary so both terms resolve to the
same results. Never make users guess the "right" terminology.

### Deflection metrics

Deflection is the percentage of users who find an answer in the knowledge base and
do not open a support ticket. It is the primary health metric for a knowledge base.

**Deflection rate formula:**

```
Deflection rate = 1 - (tickets opened after KB visit / total KB visits)
```

**Supporting metrics to track:**

| Metric | What it measures | Healthy target |
|---|---|---|
| Deflection rate | Overall KB effectiveness | > 70% |
| Article rating (thumbs) | Per-article satisfaction | > 80% positive |
| Failed search rate | Queries returning zero results | < 10% |
| Contact-us click rate post-article | Articles that fail to resolve | < 5% per article |
| Article staleness (days since reviewed) | Content freshness | < 180 days |
| Search-to-click rate | How often search results get clicked | > 60% |

## Common tasks

### Design help center architecture - taxonomy

**Step 1: Mine your ticket data**

Pull 90 days of support tickets and tag each with the user's underlying goal (not
the feature involved). The top 10 goals by volume become your category candidates.

**Step 2: Card-sort validation**

Give 8-10 representative users 20-30 article titles on cards. Ask them to group
articles into categories and name each group. Patterns appearing in 6+ of 8 users'
groupings are validated categories.

**Step 3: Build the hierarchy**

```
Level 0: Help Center home
Level 1: 5-8 goal-based categories  (e.g., "Getting Started", "Billing", "Account Settings")
Level 2: Sub-categories per Level 1  (e.g., "Billing > Invoices", "Billing > Payment Methods")
Level 3: Individual articles
```

**Step 4: Map existing content**

Audit every existing article against the new taxonomy. For each article: keep, merge,
rewrite, or archive. Do not migrate stale articles - migration is a forcing function
to decide whether content is worth keeping.

### Write effective support articles - template

See `references/article-templates.md` for full templates by article type.

**Universal writing rules:**

- Title format: verb + object + optional context. "Reset your password" not "Password Reset"
- First sentence: state exactly what the article covers and who it is for
- Steps use numbered lists; sub-steps use indented numbered lists
- Add screenshots and videos for steps where UI placement is ambiguous
- Bold the first mention of a UI element: "Click **Save changes**"
- End every article with a "Was this helpful?" rating and a link to contact support

**Length targets:**

| Article type | Target word count |
|---|---|
| How-to | 150-400 words |
| Troubleshooting | 200-600 words |
| FAQ | 50-150 words per answer |
| Reference | As long as needed; use anchor links for navigation |

### Optimize search - keywords and synonyms

**Keyword audit workflow:**

1. Export failed searches from the last 30 days (queries with zero results or zero clicks)
2. Cluster similar failed searches into synonym groups
3. For each cluster: does a relevant article exist? If yes, add synonyms. If no, add to content backlog.
4. Export low-click-rate searches (results shown but not clicked) - these indicate title mismatch
5. Rewrite article titles to match the language users use in low-click queries

**Building the synonym dictionary:**

```
Group: password
Synonyms: forgot password, reset password, change password, recover account,
          locked out, can't log in, login help

Group: cancel account
Synonyms: delete account, close account, unsubscribe, remove account,
          stop subscription, leave [product name]

Group: billing
Synonyms: invoice, receipt, charge, payment, credit card, subscription cost, price
```

Review and expand the synonym dictionary every quarter using fresh failed-search data.

### Measure and improve deflection rate

**Deflection measurement setup:**

1. Instrument your help center with session tracking
2. Define a "deflection event": user visits KB and does NOT click "Contact Support" or
   open a ticket within the same session
3. Define a "failure event": user visits KB AND opens a ticket or clicks "Contact Support"
4. Calculate: deflection rate = deflection events / (deflection + failure events)

**Deflection improvement playbook:**

| Problem signal | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| High failed search rate | Missing articles or wrong keywords | Write missing content; add synonyms |
| High contact-us rate on specific articles | Article does not resolve the issue | Rewrite with clearer steps; add edge cases |
| Low rating on specific articles | Content is wrong, outdated, or confusing | Audit against current product; rewrite |
| Low overall deflection | Wrong IA; users can't find articles | Run card sort; restructure taxonomy |

### Create article templates by type

See `references/article-templates.md` for ready-to-use templates for:
- How-to articles
- Troubleshooting articles
- FAQ articles
- Reference articles

### Build a maintenance workflow

**Content ownership model:**

Every article must have a named owner (a person, not a team). The owner is responsible
for reviewing the article when the related feature changes and on a scheduled cadence.

**Review cadence:**

| Article type | Review frequency |
|---|---|
| How-to (frequently changing features) | Every 60 days |
| How-to (stable features) | Every 180 days |
| Troubleshooting | Every 90 days |
| Reference (spec/settings tables) | Every 60 days |
| FAQ | Every 90 days |

**Maintenance workflow:**

```
Trigger:   Feature release, product change, or scheduled review date
Step 1:    Owner verifies each step against the current product
Step 2:    Update screenshots, step copy, and option names
Step 3:    Bump "Last reviewed" date in article metadata
Step 4:    If article covers removed functionality: archive, don't delete
           (external links break; archived articles should redirect to a notice)
Step 5:    Notify support team of significant changes for in-flight tickets
```

**Staleness detection automation:** Set up a script or integration that flags any
article whose "Last reviewed" date exceeds the review threshold. Pipe these to a
weekly "content health" report sent to article owners.

### Implement in-product help - contextual guidance

Contextual help surfaces the right article at the moment of need, inside the product,
without requiring the user to navigate away.

**Contextual help patterns:**

| Pattern | When to use | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Tooltip | Explain a single field or option | `?` icon next to field; 1-2 sentences max |
| Inline help text | Persistent hint below an input | Static text; use for non-obvious requirements |
| Help panel | Step-by-step guidance for a complex form or workflow | Slide-out panel linking to full KB article |
| Empty state link | Guide users on first use | "How to add your first X" in empty states |
| Error message link | Link to troubleshooting from inline errors | "Error 403. [Learn why this happens]" |

**Rules for contextual help copy:**

- Write in second person: "You can add up to 5 team members on this plan"
- State what the user can do, not what the system does
- Link to the full KB article for anything that needs more than 2 sentences
- Never duplicate the full article in a tooltip - summarize and link

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Organizing by feature/menu path | Users don't know your product structure - they know their problem | Organize by user goal; use feature names only in article body |
| Writing prose paragraphs for how-to steps | Users skip prose and miss steps; causes more tickets | Use numbered lists with one action per step |
| Copy-pasting UI labels verbatim into titles | UI labels are designed for space, not searchability | Write titles around the task users are trying to accomplish |
| No synonym dictionary | Users who use different words than your team get zero results | Build and maintain a synonym dictionary; review monthly |
| Measuring success by pageviews | High views on a bad article looks like success | Measure deflection rate and article rating; pageviews are vanity |
| Never archiving old articles | Users follow stale instructions and open tickets blaming the product | Archive any article for a removed or significantly changed feature within one sprint |

## Gotchas

1. **Failed search data is the most valuable signal and most teams ignore it** - Most help center analytics dashboards surface pageviews and article ratings. The highest-signal data is failed searches (queries that return zero results or zero clicks). These are users who came looking for help and left empty-handed. Pull this report weekly and treat it as a content gap backlog.

2. **Organizing by product feature structure instead of user mental model causes high bounce rates** - When users see categories like "Workspace Settings > Members > Invitation Flow" they have to translate their problem ("how do I add someone") into your product's internal taxonomy. Users who can't find the category in 3 seconds leave and open a ticket. Always validate category names with real users before launching.

3. **Article titles written for SEO but not for scanning produce low click rates in search** - A title like "Complete Guide to Password Management in Your Account Settings" is verbose and buries the action. Users scanning search results for "reset password" need to see those words in the title. Keep titles short, verb-first, and match the exact language users type when searching.

4. **High article ratings on outdated content create a false health signal** - Users who found a workaround or figured it out on their own often rate the article positively despite it being partially wrong. Article staleness tracking (days since last review) must run in parallel with ratings - a 4-star article that hasn't been reviewed in 18 months for a changing feature is still a liability.

5. **Deflection rate drops are invisible without session-level tracking** - If you measure deflection as "tickets opened / total KB pageviews" instead of at the session level, you can't tell whether users who opened tickets also visited the KB first. Session-level tracking (user visited KB then opened a ticket within the same session) is the only accurate failure signal.
