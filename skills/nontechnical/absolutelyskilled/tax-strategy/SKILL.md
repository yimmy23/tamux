# Tax Strategy

A practical framework for corporate tax planning, compliance, and optimization.
Tax is one of the largest and most controllable operating expenses for a growing
company - yet most founders and operators treat it reactively, filing returns
after the year closes and leaving significant credits and deductions unclaimed.
This skill covers the full tax lifecycle: entity structuring, R&D credit
identification, sales tax and VAT nexus management, transfer pricing for
international operations, quarterly estimated tax management, and audit
preparation.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks about R&D tax credits, Section 41 credits, or qualifying R&D activities
- Needs to determine sales tax or VAT nexus for a new state or country
- Is structuring a subsidiary, IP holding entity, or international expansion
- Asks about transfer pricing policies between related entities
- Needs to prepare for a tax audit or respond to a tax authority inquiry
- Wants to optimize quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties
- Asks about corporate income tax rates, deductions, or timing strategies
- Is evaluating entity type (C-Corp, S-Corp, LLC, pass-through) for tax impact

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Personal income tax filing or individual tax returns - use a personal finance skill
- GAAP revenue recognition or financial statement accounting - use an accounting skill

## Key principles

1. **Plan proactively, not reactively** - Tax strategy executed before a
   transaction or year-end is worth 10x more than cleanup after the fact.
   Entity elections, R&D credit documentation, and transfer pricing policies
   must be in place before the relevant period ends - they cannot be backdated.

2. **Document everything** - The IRS and most tax authorities shift the burden
   of proof to the taxpayer. No documentation means no deduction or credit.
   R&D activities, business purpose for expenses, and intercompany agreements
   must be contemporaneously recorded, not reconstructed during an audit.

3. **R&D credits are systematically underutilized** - Fewer than 30% of
   eligible companies claim the federal R&D credit. Most qualifying activities
   are ordinary engineering work - debugging, prototyping, iterating on
   algorithms, designing new features - not just lab research. The credit can
   offset payroll taxes for early-stage companies.

4. **Nexus determines obligation** - You owe sales tax or VAT only where you
   have nexus (a sufficient connection to that jurisdiction). Physical presence
   used to be the only trigger; economic nexus rules (typically $100K in sales
   or 200 transactions per state) now apply in every US state. Map your nexus
   before collection obligations snowball into back-tax liability.

5. **Transfer pricing must be arm's length** - When related entities transact
   (parent charges subsidiary for IP, services, or goods), the price must be
   what unrelated parties would agree to. Failure to document arm's-length
   pricing is one of the most common triggers for international tax audits and
   can result in double taxation.

## Core concepts

**Corporate income tax** is levied on a corporation's net taxable income.
The US federal corporate rate is 21% (post-2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). State
rates vary from 0% (Wyoming, South Dakota) to over 11% (New Jersey). Taxable
income differs from book income due to depreciation methods, timing of
deduction recognition, and credits that directly reduce tax liability (not
just taxable income).

**Nexus and permanent establishment (PE)** are the thresholds that create a
tax collection or income tax obligation. For US sales tax: physical nexus
(office, employee, warehouse) or economic nexus (revenue or transaction
thresholds). For international income tax: a permanent establishment typically
arises when a company has a fixed place of business or a dependent agent in a
foreign country - triggering that country's corporate income tax.

**R&D credit qualification** under IRC Section 41 requires four-part test:
(1) qualified purpose - developing a new or improved business component;
(2) technological in nature - relies on hard sciences, engineering, or computer
science; (3) elimination of uncertainty - attempts to eliminate technical
uncertainty; (4) process of experimentation - evaluates alternatives through
modeling, simulation, testing, or trial and error. Qualifying expenditures
include wages, contract research (65% of amounts paid to US contractors), and
supplies consumed in research.

**Transfer pricing methods** are the IRS/OECD-approved approaches for pricing
intercompany transactions: Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) - compare to
identical third-party transactions; Cost Plus - cost of production plus arm's
length markup; Resale Price - resale price minus appropriate gross margin;
Comparable Profits Method (CPM) / Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) -
compare operating margin to comparable companies; Profit Split - allocate
combined profit based on relative contribution. Most mid-market companies use
CPM/TNMM because comparable third-party transactions are hard to find.

## Common tasks

### Identify R&D credit opportunities

**Qualification criteria checklist:**

| Test | Question to ask | Examples that qualify |
|---|---|---|
| Qualified purpose | Are you developing or improving a product, process, software, or formula? | New feature, performance optimization, new algorithm |
| Technological in nature | Does the work rely on engineering, computer science, or physical sciences? | Backend architecture, ML model design, circuit design |
| Elimination of uncertainty | Is there technical uncertainty about how to achieve the result? | "We don't know if this approach will scale to 10M requests" |
| Process of experimentation | Are you testing alternatives, iterating, or running experiments? | A/B testing architecture choices, profiling and tuning |

**Qualifying expenditures:**
- **Wages** - W-2 wages for employees whose time is spent on qualified research. Track time by project. Even partial time qualifies (e.g., 40% of a developer's time on a qualifying project = 40% of their wages).
- **Contract research** - 65% of amounts paid to US-based third-party contractors performing qualified research on your behalf.
- **Supplies** - Materials and supplies consumed in the research process (not capital equipment, which is depreciated separately).

**Startup benefit:** Companies with less than $5M in gross receipts and fewer than 5 years of revenue can apply up to $500K/year of R&D credits against employer payroll taxes (FICA) - even with no income tax liability. This is often the most valuable tax benefit available to early-stage tech companies.

**Documentation to maintain contemporaneously:**
- Project descriptions explaining the technical uncertainty and experimentation
- Time logs or percentage estimates tied to individual employees and projects
- Payroll records cross-referenced to project time
- Meeting notes, design docs, code commits, and test records as evidence of experimentation

### Plan for sales tax and VAT compliance

**US sales tax nexus checklist:**

Physical nexus triggers (any one creates nexus):
- [ ] Office, store, or warehouse in the state
- [ ] Employee, contractor, or sales rep working in the state
- [ ] Inventory stored in a fulfillment center (including Amazon FBA) in the state
- [ ] Attending trade shows or conducting in-person sales activities

Economic nexus triggers (post-South Dakota v. Wayfair, 2018):
- [ ] More than $100,000 in sales to that state in the current or prior year
- [ ] More than 200 separate transactions to that state in the current or prior year
- Note: Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Delaware have no state sales tax

**Action steps once nexus is determined:**
1. Register for a sales tax permit in the state before collecting (collecting without registration is a separate violation)
2. Determine taxability - software-as-a-service is taxable in some states, exempt in others; consult a tax advisor for your product category
3. Configure your billing system to collect and remit by state (Stripe Tax, Avalara, TaxJar)
4. File returns on the schedule required by each state (monthly, quarterly, or annually based on volume)

**VAT considerations for EU/UK:**
- EU VAT OSS (One Stop Shop) allows a single EU registration to cover all 27 EU member states for B2C digital services
- UK requires separate VAT registration (threshold: £90,000 in UK sales)
- B2B sales within the EU typically use the reverse charge mechanism - buyer accounts for VAT
- Digital services sold to EU consumers are taxable at the buyer's country rate, regardless of where the seller is located

### Design a transfer pricing strategy

Transfer pricing applies when your company has multiple legal entities transacting with each other (e.g., a US parent licensing IP to an Irish subsidiary, or a US entity receiving management services from a Singapore holding company).

**Step 1 - Map intercompany transactions:**
List every transaction between related entities: IP licenses, management fees, cost sharing, intercompany loans, goods sales, shared services.

**Step 2 - Select a method:**
| Transaction type | Recommended method |
|---|---|
| IP licenses / royalties | CUP (if third-party royalty data available) or Profit Split |
| Services (routine) | Cost Plus with a standard markup (typically 5-15%) |
| Distribution / resale | Resale Price Method or TNMM |
| Manufacturing | Cost Plus or TNMM |
| Loans | Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) as minimum arm's-length rate |

**Step 3 - Benchmark:**
Use databases like Bureau van Dijk Orbis, RoyaltyStat, or ktMINE to find comparable uncontrolled transactions or comparable companies to support your pricing.

**Step 4 - Document in a transfer pricing study:**
Most countries with transfer pricing rules require contemporaneous documentation. The OECD BEPS framework requires a Master File (group-wide overview) and Local File (entity-specific) for large multinationals.

**Common pitfall:** Do not set intercompany prices to minimize tax without economic substance. A subsidiary must perform real functions and bear real risks to justify a low-tax allocation of profits. Substance requirements include local employees, decision-making authority, and actual risk management.

---

### Structure international operations tax-efficiently

**IP holding structure:**
Holding IP in a low-tax jurisdiction (Ireland, Netherlands, Singapore) is legitimate when the entity has genuine substance - employees who manage the IP, make licensing decisions, and bear economic risk. The OECD BEPS Action 5 "nexus approach" requires that tax benefits track to the jurisdiction where R&D is actually performed.

**Structuring checklist before expanding internationally:**
- [ ] Determine if a foreign subsidiary or branch is appropriate (subsidiaries limit liability and separate tax; branches flow through to parent)
- [ ] Assess permanent establishment risk - does a traveling employee or a local contractor create PE in the new country?
- [ ] Review applicable tax treaty between home country and target country
- [ ] Determine withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, and royalties between the two jurisdictions
- [ ] Consult a local tax advisor in the target jurisdiction before entity formation

**US-specific: Subpart F and GILTI**
US corporations with foreign subsidiaries must include certain categories of passive or easily-shifted income (Subpart F income) in US taxable income currently. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) regime taxes US multinationals on excess foreign profits. These rules significantly limit the benefit of parking income in low-tax foreign entities without genuine substance.

### Prepare for a tax audit

**Types of audits:**
- **Correspondence audit** - IRS requests documentation by mail; most common; respond in writing with supporting documents
- **Office audit** - Scheduled meeting at an IRS office; bring all requested records
- **Field audit** - IRS agent comes to your place of business; most serious; retain a tax attorney or CPA immediately

**Audit readiness checklist:**
- [ ] Maintain organized records for at least 3 years from filing date (6 years if substantial understatement is possible; indefinitely if fraud is alleged)
- [ ] Keep a reconciliation between book income and taxable income (M-1 or M-3 schedule)
- [ ] Retain all source documents: bank statements, invoices, contracts, payroll records, mileage logs
- [ ] Document business purpose for all deducted expenses
- [ ] Keep transfer pricing documentation current
- [ ] Maintain contemporaneous R&D documentation

**If selected for audit:**
1. Do not respond to the IRS directly without a tax professional for anything beyond simple correspondence audits
2. Respond only to what is asked - do not volunteer additional information
3. Request a 30-day extension if needed to gather documentation
4. Understand the statute of limitations: IRS generally has 3 years to audit; 6 years if income is understated by >25%; no limit for fraud

### Manage quarterly estimated taxes

Corporations and pass-through entities with expected annual tax liability above $500 (individuals) or $500 (corporations) must make quarterly estimated payments or face an underpayment penalty.

**Corporate estimated tax schedule (US):**
| Quarter | Due date |
|---|---|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | April 15 |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | June 15 |
| Q3 (Jul-Sep) | September 15 |
| Q4 (Oct-Dec) | December 15 |

**Safe harbor rules to avoid underpayment penalty:**
- Pay 100% of prior year's tax liability (25% per quarter), OR
- Pay 100% of current year's actual liability as you go (annualized income method)

**For C-Corps:** The safe harbor is 100% of prior year tax. Large corporations (taxable income >$1M in any of the prior 3 years) must use 100% of current year estimates.

**Cash flow tip:** Use the prior-year safe harbor when this year is expected to be a high-income year. Use the annualized income method when income is weighted toward early quarters and the business slows later in the year.

---

### Optimize entity structure

**Entity comparison for US businesses:**

| Entity | Tax treatment | Key advantage | Key disadvantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-Corporation | Double taxation (21% corp + 15-20% dividend) | QSB stock exclusion (QSBS), no income limit for deductions, investor-friendly | Dividends taxed twice; distributions not deductible |
| S-Corporation | Pass-through (no entity tax) | Avoid self-employment tax on distributions | Limits: 100 shareholders max, US citizens/residents only, one class of stock |
| LLC (single/multi) | Pass-through by default | Flexible profit allocation, no formality requirements | Self-employment tax on all active income unless S-Corp election made |
| Partnership | Pass-through | Flexible allocations, step-up in basis on contribution | SE tax, complexity of Schedule K-1 |

**QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) - Section 1202:**
Shareholders of a C-Corp can exclude up to $10M (or 10x basis, whichever is greater) of gain from federal capital gains tax if the stock was issued when the company had less than $50M in assets and held for more than 5 years. This is the single largest potential tax benefit available to startup founders and early investors. Entity must be a C-Corp at time of issuance - S-Corps and LLCs do not qualify.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Filing taxes without reviewing prior-year elections | Elections like accounting methods, depreciation, or R&D credit elections must often be made with the original return; missed elections are hard to fix | Review all available elections with your CPA before filing; use an extension if needed |
| Treating R&D as all-or-nothing | Companies assume only dedicated "R&D teams" qualify, leaving substantial payroll credits unclaimed | Audit all engineering, product, and QA wages; partial-time allocation qualifies |
| Collecting sales tax without registration | Collecting without a permit is a separate violation; states can assess penalties beyond the tax itself | Register before collecting; consider a VDA (Voluntary Disclosure Agreement) for past exposure |
| Setting intercompany prices to a round number without benchmarking | Round numbers signal that pricing was set without economic analysis; automatic audit red flag | Support all intercompany prices with a contemporaneous benchmarking study |
| Missing the S-Corp reasonable salary requirement | S-Corp owners who take no salary to avoid payroll tax face IRS reclassification of distributions as wages | Pay a reasonable salary (market rate for the services performed) before taking distributions |
| Waiting until December to do tax planning | Year-end planning has limited options; most high-impact strategies (retirement plan setup, equipment purchases, entity elections) require action before December 31 | Review tax position quarterly; engage a CPA in Q3 for year-end planning |

## Gotchas

1. **R&D credits require contemporaneous documentation, not retroactive reconstruction** - The IRS can and does reject R&D credit claims where time logs were created after the fact. Time-tracking systems must be running before the tax year you intend to claim. Reconstructed records from Jira or git history alone are not sufficient.

2. **Economic nexus thresholds are based on prior-year activity, not current-year** - Many states look at the prior calendar year to determine if the current year creates nexus. A company that crossed $100K in sales to California in 2023 has nexus there starting January 1, 2024 - not the day they crossed the threshold.

3. **QSBS exclusion requires the company to be a C-Corp at issuance** - Converting from LLC to C-Corp after investors receive units does not retroactively qualify. The shares must be original-issue C-Corp stock when issued. Advise on entity type before any equity grants.

4. **S-Corp reasonable compensation is not optional** - The IRS actively audits S-Corp owner-operators who pay themselves below-market salaries. The standard is what the company would pay a third party to do the same job, not what feels tax-efficient.

5. **Sales tax registration must precede collection** - Collecting sales tax before obtaining a state permit is a separate violation from failure to collect. Some states treat collection without registration as fraud. Register before enabling tax collection in billing systems.
