# Bookkeeping Automation

Bookkeeping is the systematic recording and organizing of all financial transactions
for a business. Done well, it produces a reliable single source of truth for every
dollar in and out, enabling confident decision-making, clean audits, and accurate
tax filings. Automation shifts the work from data entry to exception handling -
the machine reconciles the routine, the human resolves the unusual.

This skill covers the design and automation of core bookkeeping workflows: chart of
accounts architecture, bank and credit card reconciliation, accounts payable and
receivable pipelines, month-end close checklists, recurring journal entries, and
expense management. It applies equally to spreadsheet-based setups, QuickBooks,
Xero, NetSuite, and custom-built finance tooling.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Asks how to design or restructure a chart of accounts
- Needs to automate or streamline bank reconciliation
- Wants to build or improve an accounts payable (AP) workflow
- Wants to build or improve an accounts receivable (AR) and collections process
- Asks about month-end or year-end close procedures
- Needs to create or automate recurring journal entries or accruals
- Wants to implement an expense management and reimbursement system
- Asks about the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting

Do NOT trigger this skill for:

- Tax strategy, tax planning, or tax filing preparation (use a tax-specialist skill)
- Financial modeling, forecasting, or FP&A (bookkeeping records history; FP&A projects forward)

## Key principles

1. **Double-entry is non-negotiable** - Every transaction touches at least two accounts:
   a debit and a credit of equal value. This self-balancing property is what makes
   accounting auditable. Never design a system that records only one side.

2. **Classify at the source** - The cheapest time to categorize a transaction is
   when it first enters the system. Reclassifying entries later is expensive and
   error-prone. Design intake workflows (AP approval, expense submission, bank feed
   rules) to capture the correct account, department, and project code upfront.

3. **Reconciliation is the heartbeat** - Reconcile bank and credit card accounts
   at minimum monthly, ideally weekly. Unreconciled books drift from reality.
   Reconciliation is what transforms a transaction log into trustworthy financials.

4. **Separate duties** - The person who approves a payment should not be the same
   person who processes it. The person who records a journal entry should not be
   the only person who reviews it. Segregation of duties prevents both fraud and
   honest error.

5. **Automate the routine, review the exception** - Use bank feed rules, recurring
   transaction templates, and scheduled journal entries for predictable items.
   Reserve human attention for variance investigation, approval workflows, and
   anything over a materiality threshold.

## Core concepts

### Double-entry bookkeeping

Every financial event is recorded as a pair of equal and opposite entries. Debits
increase asset and expense accounts; credits increase liability, equity, and revenue
accounts. The fundamental equation always holds:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

A simple example - paying a $500 vendor invoice:

```
Debit:  Accounts Payable   $500   (reduce liability)
Credit: Cash/Bank           $500   (reduce asset)
```

### Chart of accounts structure

The chart of accounts (COA) is the master list of every account used to classify
transactions. A well-structured COA uses a numeric scheme that groups by type:

| Range     | Type               | Examples                              |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1000-1999 | Assets             | Cash, AR, Inventory, Fixed Assets     |
| 2000-2999 | Liabilities        | AP, Credit Cards, Loans, Deferred Rev |
| 3000-3999 | Equity             | Common Stock, Retained Earnings       |
| 4000-4999 | Revenue            | Product Sales, Service Revenue        |
| 5000-5999 | Cost of Goods Sold | Direct Labor, Materials, Fulfillment  |
| 6000-6999 | Operating Expenses | Payroll, Rent, Software, Marketing    |
| 7000-7999 | Other Income/Expense | Interest Income, Gain/Loss on Sale  |

Keep the COA as flat as possible. Sub-accounts add granularity but also complexity.
Add a new account only when reporting genuinely requires it - not speculatively.

### Accrual vs. cash basis

| Dimension         | Cash Basis                          | Accrual Basis                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Revenue recorded  | When cash is received               | When earned (invoice sent or service done) |
| Expense recorded  | When cash is paid                   | When incurred (bill received or work done) |
| Accuracy          | Simpler, matches bank               | More accurate picture of financial health  |
| Required for      | Small businesses, sole traders      | Companies >$25M revenue (US GAAP), audit   |
| Key accounts      | No AR, no AP                        | AR, AP, accrued liabilities, prepaid       |

Most growing businesses should use accrual. Cash basis can mask real obligations
(e.g., a large unpaid bill not showing up as an expense yet).

### Reconciliation

Reconciliation is the process of comparing two sets of records to ensure they agree.
Types:

- **Bank reconciliation** - Match the general ledger cash account to the bank statement.
  Identify timing differences (outstanding checks, deposits-in-transit) and errors.
- **Credit card reconciliation** - Match the credit card GL account to the card statement.
- **AR aging reconciliation** - Ensure the AR subledger total matches the AR control account.
- **AP aging reconciliation** - Ensure the AP subledger total matches the AP control account.
- **Balance sheet reconciliation** - Every BS account should have a schedule supporting
  its balance (e.g., fixed asset roll-forward, prepaid amortization schedule).

## Common tasks

### Design a chart of accounts

1. Start with the standard numeric ranges above. Reserve gaps (e.g., 1100-1199 for
   cash, 1200-1299 for AR) so related accounts cluster together.
2. Map every real transaction type to an account. If a transaction cannot be mapped,
   add an account - but never use a catch-all "Miscellaneous" account for regular activity.
3. Define a naming convention and enforce it: `[Type] - [Detail]`, e.g.,
   `6200 - Software Subscriptions`, `6210 - Software Subscriptions - Engineering`.
4. Create departments or classes at the reporting layer, not by multiplying accounts.
   Use one `6100 - Payroll` account with a department tag, not separate payroll accounts
   per team.
5. Review quarterly: retire unused accounts, merge near-duplicates, add only what
   reporting genuinely requires.

### Automate bank reconciliation

**Manual process baseline:**
```
1. Export bank statement (CSV or OFX)
2. Import into accounting system or spreadsheet
3. Match each bank line to a GL entry by date, amount, and description
4. Flag unmatched items on either side
5. Investigate and resolve exceptions
6. Sign off when difference = 0
```

**Automation levers:**
- **Bank feed rules** - In QuickBooks/Xero, create rules that auto-categorize
  recurring transactions by payee name or description pattern (e.g., "STRIPE" -> Revenue).
- **Fuzzy matching scripts** - For custom setups, match bank lines to GL entries
  by amount tolerance and date window (±1 day, ±$0.01).
- **Auto-import OFX/CSV** - Schedule a daily import so the feed is never more than
  24 hours stale.
- **Exception queues** - Surface only the unmatched items for human review. The
  matched 90% should require zero human time.

**Key reconciliation formula:**
```
Bank Statement Ending Balance
+ Deposits in Transit
- Outstanding Checks
+/- Bank Errors
= Adjusted Bank Balance

GL Cash Balance
+/- GL Errors / Unrecorded Items
= Adjusted Book Balance

Adjusted Bank Balance must equal Adjusted Book Balance
```

### Manage AP workflow

A clean AP process has five stages with clear owners:

1. **Receive** - Vendor sends invoice. Route to a single AP email inbox or portal.
   Capture: vendor, amount, due date, PO number (if applicable).
2. **Code** - AP team assigns GL account, department/class, and project. Verify
   against purchase order or contract if over approval threshold.
3. **Approve** - Require digital approval from budget owner. Use a materiality
   ladder: e.g., <$500 AP auto-approves, $500-$5K requires manager, >$5K requires CFO.
4. **Pay** - Batch payments on a schedule (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday). Record the
   payment in the GL on the date the funds leave. Use ACH over checks where possible.
5. **Reconcile** - Confirm paid invoices clear in AP aging. Reconcile AP subledger
   to control account at month-end.

**Automation targets:**
- Auto-extract invoice data with OCR (e.g., Dext, Hubdoc, AWS Textract)
- Duplicate invoice detection by vendor + amount + date proximity
- Auto-match invoices to purchase orders (3-way match: PO, receipt, invoice)
- Scheduled payment runs with pre-built approval email workflows

### Manage AR and collections

AR management is revenue already earned but not yet collected. Aging matters:

| Age Bucket     | Action                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0-30 days      | Standard - no action unless terms exceeded |
| 31-60 days     | Automated reminder email                   |
| 61-90 days     | Personal outreach from AR team             |
| 91-120 days    | Escalate to account manager or leadership  |
| 120+ days      | Consider write-off or collections agency   |

**Automation targets:**
- Auto-generate and send invoices from billing system on trigger (usage, milestone, date)
- Automated dunning sequence: email at net+1, net+7, net+14, net+30 overdue
- Payment portal link in every invoice email (Stripe, PayPal, ACH direct)
- Weekly AR aging report auto-emailed to finance and sales leadership
- Auto-apply cash receipts to oldest open invoices (FIFO matching)

**Month-end AR tasks:**
- Reconcile AR subledger total to GL control account
- Review aging for bad debt candidates
- Post allowance for doubtful accounts entry if needed

### Streamline month-end close

See `references/month-end-checklist.md` for the full detailed checklist.

**High-level close sequence:**

```
Week 1 of close:
  [ ] Lock prior-period transactions (prevent backdated entries)
  [ ] Complete bank and credit card reconciliations
  [ ] Reconcile AR and AP subledgers to control accounts
  [ ] Process payroll journal entries

Week 2 of close:
  [ ] Post depreciation and amortization entries
  [ ] Post accruals (uninvoiced expenses, deferred revenue adjustments)
  [ ] Post prepaid amortization
  [ ] Reconcile intercompany accounts (if applicable)

Final close steps:
  [ ] Review trial balance for anomalies
  [ ] Tie revenue to billing system
  [ ] Run flux analysis (month-over-month variance review)
  [ ] CFO/Controller sign-off
  [ ] Lock period in accounting system
  [ ] Distribute financial package
```

Target a 5 business day close. Every day over 5 is a process failure worth investigating.

### Automate recurring journal entries

Recurring entries are predictable in amount or calculation method. Automate them
with templates that post on a schedule:

| Entry Type              | Frequency | Calculation                              |
|-------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| Depreciation            | Monthly   | Asset cost / useful life months          |
| Prepaid amortization    | Monthly   | Prepaid balance / remaining months       |
| Accrued payroll         | Monthly   | Days worked but unpaid at period-end     |
| Deferred revenue release| Monthly   | Contract value / contract months         |
| Interest accrual        | Monthly   | Outstanding loan balance * (rate / 12)   |

**Template structure for any recurring JE:**
```
Entry name:    [Descriptive name - no abbreviations]
Debit account: [Account number and name]
Credit account:[Account number and name]
Amount method: [Fixed / Formula / % of balance]
Frequency:     [Monthly / Quarterly / Annual]
Auto-reverse:  [Yes for accruals / No for amortization]
Memo:          [Period: {month} {year} - {description}]
```

Set accruals to auto-reverse on the first day of the next period. This prevents
the accrual from permanently inflating the expense balance when the actual invoice arrives.

### Implement expense management

A clean expense process prevents both fraud and friction:

1. **Policy first** - Publish a clear expense policy: what's reimbursable, per-diems,
   receipt thresholds, approval chains. No policy means no enforcement.
2. **Capture at point of purchase** - Employees photograph receipts immediately
   (Expensify, Ramp, Brex). Never rely on paper receipts surviving a month.
3. **Code on submission** - Employee selects category and project. Finance reviews,
   not re-enters.
4. **Approval workflow** - Manager approves via email or app before finance processes.
5. **Sync to GL** - Connect expense tool to accounting system. Entries post automatically
   with correct account, department, and project coding.
6. **Reimburse on schedule** - Process reimbursements on a fixed weekly cadence.
   Unpredictable reimbursement is a major employee satisfaction issue.

**For company card programs:**
- Issue cards with individual spend limits and MCC (merchant category code) restrictions
- Require receipt + memo within 48 hours of transaction
- Auto-lock cards with outstanding unreconciled transactions over 30 days

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Using a single "Miscellaneous Expense" account for anything unusual | Makes financials unauditable; hides real spend patterns | Create the right account. If it recurs twice, it deserves its own account |
| Recording expenses on cash basis while using accrual for revenue | Produces misleading P&L - expenses are understated relative to the revenue they generated | Pick accrual or cash consistently and apply it to both sides |
| Reconciling only at year-end | Errors compound over 12 months; finding a $50K discrepancy in December is a crisis | Reconcile bank accounts monthly at minimum, AR/AP weekly |
| Letting AP aging grow unchecked | Late payments damage vendor relationships and can trigger supply disruptions | Review AP aging weekly; pay on agreed terms, not whenever |
| Auto-posting all bank feed transactions without review | Bank feed rules misfire; creates a false sense of reconciliation while errors accumulate | Review and approve bank feed matches before they post, or review exceptions daily |
| Not using auto-reversing entries for accruals | Accrual posts in Month 1; actual invoice also posts in Month 2; expense is double-counted | Always set accruals to auto-reverse on the first day of the following period |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Bank feed rules that auto-post without review create silent errors** - Bank feed rules in QuickBooks/Xero match by payee name or description pattern. When a vendor changes their billing descriptor, the rule stops matching and transactions land in an uncategorized account. Auto-approved rules mean this can accumulate for months. Review unmatched and newly categorized transactions daily.

2. **Accruals without auto-reverse cause double-counting** - If you post an accrued expense in Month 1 (e.g., $5K for uninvoiced consulting) and then the actual invoice also posts in Month 2, the expense appears twice. Always enable auto-reverse on accrual entries so they zero out on the first day of the next period before the actual invoice arrives.

3. **AR aging report total not matching the GL control account signals a subledger problem** - If the sum of all open invoices in the AR subledger doesn't match the AR balance on the general ledger, there's an unrecorded transaction, a manual journal entry that bypassed the subledger, or a data integrity issue. This must be resolved before month-end close, not ignored.

4. **Cash basis and accrual basis entries mixed in the same period produce meaningless financials** - Recording revenue when invoiced (accrual) but expenses when paid (cash) in the same reporting period makes the P&L unreadable and legally problematic. Pick one method and apply it consistently to both revenue and expense recognition.

5. **A `Miscellaneous Expense` catch-all account that grows is an audit flag** - Using a catch-all for transactions that don't fit neatly signals inadequate COA design. Auditors flag high-balance miscellaneous accounts immediately. Any transaction category that appears more than twice per quarter deserves its own account.
