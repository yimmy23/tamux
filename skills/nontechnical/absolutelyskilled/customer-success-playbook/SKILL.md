# Customer Success Playbook

Customer Success (CS) is the discipline of ensuring customers achieve their
desired outcomes using your product - making churn prevention a byproduct of
genuine value delivery rather than a reactive damage-control function. This skill
covers the full CS operating model: health scoring, onboarding design, churn
prediction, expansion identification, QBR execution, segmentation, and team
performance measurement.

---

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Needs to build or improve a customer health scoring system
- Wants to design or audit an onboarding playbook
- Asks how to predict, detect, or prevent customer churn
- Needs to identify expansion and upsell opportunities
- Wants to run effective Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)
- Asks how to segment customers by value or risk tier
- Needs to define CS team KPIs or OKRs
- Is working on NRR (Net Revenue Retention) or GRR (Gross Revenue Retention) improvement

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Product roadmap prioritization driven purely by engineering constraints (use product-strategy skills)
- Sales prospecting, lead scoring, or new logo acquisition (pre-sale belongs to sales enablement)

## Key principles

1. **Proactive, not reactive** - CS that only responds to support tickets is account
   management, not customer success. Intervene before customers feel pain. The best
   save is the one that never needed saving.

2. **Health scores drive action** - A health score that lives in a dashboard but
   never triggers a workflow is decoration. Every health band must have an associated
   motion: what the CSM does, when, and how. Score without action is noise.

3. **Onboarding determines lifetime value** - The first 30-90 days set the trajectory
   for the entire customer relationship. Customers who reach their first "aha moment"
   quickly retain at 2-3x the rate of those who struggle. Invest disproportionately
   in time-to-value.

4. **Expansion is earned, not sold** - Upsells from customers who haven't achieved
   their desired outcomes produce churn, not growth. Expansion should follow proven
   value, not quota pressure. The signal to expand is the customer asking for more,
   not the CSM pitching more.

5. **Segment by value and risk** - Not all customers deserve the same coverage model.
   High-ARR accounts need white-glove, human-led success. Low-ARR accounts need
   scalable, tech-touch programs. Mismatching coverage to tier burns CSM capacity on
   accounts that can't justify the cost and underserves accounts that need attention.

## Core concepts

### The CS lifecycle

Every customer moves through predictable phases, each with distinct success criteria:

| Phase | Duration | Goal | Key risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Onboarding | Days 1-90 | First value realization | Slow time-to-value, scope creep |
| Adoption | Months 3-12 | Broad, deep usage across team | Shallow single-user adoption |
| Renewal | 90 days before renewal | Confirmed ROI, signed renewal | Surprise objections at renewal |
| Expansion | Post-renewal or milestone | Upsell based on proven value | Premature pitching |
| Advocacy | Ongoing | Reference, case study, promoter | Neglect after expansion |

### Health score components

A well-designed health score is a weighted composite of leading indicators that
predict renewal probability. Common dimensions and typical weights:

| Dimension | Signal examples | Typical weight |
|---|---|---|
| Product usage | DAU/WAU, feature adoption depth, seats used/licensed | 30-40% |
| Engagement | CSM touchpoint frequency, sponsor responsiveness | 20-25% |
| Outcomes | Goals achieved vs. committed, ROI metrics | 20-25% |
| Support | Ticket volume, CSAT, unresolved critical issues | 10-15% |
| Relationship | Executive sponsor status, champion stability, NPS | 10-15% |

See `references/health-score-model.md` for the detailed weighted model and threshold design.

### Churn indicators

**Leading indicators (intervene now):**
- Login frequency drops >30% week-over-week for 2+ consecutive weeks
- Champion or executive sponsor changes roles or leaves
- Support ticket volume spikes with CSAT below 3/5
- Renewal conversation not started within 90-day window
- Customer misses two consecutive scheduled CSM touchpoints

**Lagging indicators (harder to reverse):**
- Customer requests data export
- Customer asks about contract termination clauses
- NPS drops to detractor (0-6) territory

### Expansion signals

- **Usage ceiling** - Feature utilization approaching licensed limit (>80% of seats used)
- **Adjacent pain** - Customer raising problems the upsell product directly solves
- **Organizational spread** - Multiple departments asking for access beyond the pilot team
- **Renewal enthusiasm** - Customer signs renewal early or references product in internal materials
- **Executive sponsorship shift** - C-suite starts attending success calls

## Common tasks

### Build a customer health scoring system

Design a weighted, multi-dimensional model that produces a single score (0-100) and
a color-coded band (Red / Yellow / Green) with automatic CSM action triggers.

**Step 1 - Define dimensions and weights.**
Select 4-6 dimensions relevant to your business. Product usage should carry the
highest weight (30-40%) because it is objective and hardest to fake.

**Step 2 - Normalize each dimension to 0-100.**
Map each raw metric to a 0-100 sub-score using thresholds. Example for usage:
- <20% of seats active in last 30 days = 0
- 20-49% = 40, 50-74% = 70, 75-100% = 100

**Step 3 - Apply weights and compute composite.**
`health_score = (usage * 0.35) + (engagement * 0.25) + (outcomes * 0.20) + (support * 0.10) + (relationship * 0.10)`

**Step 4 - Define bands and mandatory actions.**

| Band | Score range | CSM action |
|---|---|---|
| Green | 75-100 | Expansion motion, reference request |
| Yellow | 50-74 | Scheduled check-in within 7 days, risk assessment |
| Red | 0-49 | Executive escalation within 48 hours, save plan |

**Step 5 - Build a feedback loop.** Compare health score 90 days prior to renewal
against actual renewal outcome. Tune weights until model achieves >75% predictive
accuracy for churn.

See `references/health-score-model.md` for the full scoring template.

### Design an onboarding playbook

Onboarding ends when the customer achieves their first committed outcome, not when
technical setup is complete. Structure around milestones, not calendar dates.

**Milestone 1 - Technical kickoff (Days 1-7)**
- Stakeholder alignment: map goals to product capabilities
- Technical setup complete: integrations, SSO, data imports
- Success plan signed: 3-5 measurable goals with target dates

**Milestone 2 - First value realization (Days 14-30)**
- Core use case live with real data
- At least 3 active users beyond the champion
- Customer can demonstrate the product unaided

**Milestone 3 - Team adoption (Days 30-60)**
- >60% of licensed seats active
- Secondary use case identified or live

**Milestone 4 - Outcome confirmation (Days 60-90)**
- At least one success plan goal achieved or measurably progressing
- EBR scheduled with executive sponsor
- Expansion signals documented for account plan

### Predict and prevent churn - early warning system

**Tiered alert triggers:**

| Alert level | Trigger criteria | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Watch | Health score drops from Green to Yellow | CSM schedules check-in within 7 days |
| Warning | Yellow for 21+ days, or any single dimension at 0 | CSM escalates, builds risk mitigation plan |
| Critical | Health score Red, OR champion departs, OR formal complaint | Executive engagement within 48 hours, save plan |

**Save plan template:**
1. Root cause analysis - what drove the score down?
2. Executive alignment - is there internal will to stay?
3. Remediation actions - concrete steps with owners and dates
4. Success criteria - what does "saved" look like at 30/60/90 days?
5. Go/no-go checkpoint - if criteria not met, prepare graceful offboarding

### Identify expansion opportunities - signals and timing

**Qualification criteria before starting an expansion motion:**
- Health score Green for at least 60 consecutive days
- At least one success plan goal achieved with documented ROI
- Champion actively engaged
- Renewal is not within 60 days

**Expansion conversation framework:**
1. Anchor to achieved value - reference a specific metric
2. Surface the adjacent pain - ask about problems the expanded product solves
3. Quantify the gap - help the customer estimate the cost of not solving it
4. Propose a pilot or phased expansion
5. Involve the AE for formal commercial motion; CSM does not own the close

### Run effective QBRs - agenda

A QBR is a strategic alignment meeting, not a product demo. Target audience is
executive sponsors; goal is confirming strategic value and setting next-quarter direction.

**QBR agenda (60 minutes):**

| Time | Section | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 0-5 min | Welcome and objectives | CSM |
| 5-20 min | Results: goals vs. actuals from last quarter | CSM + Customer champion |
| 20-30 min | Value realized: ROI story with business metrics | CSM |
| 30-40 min | Challenges and open risks (honest) | Both sides |
| 40-50 min | Goals and success criteria for next quarter | Customer executive |
| 50-60 min | Product roadmap alignment + asks from customer | CSM + AE |

**Preparation checklist:** Pull 90-day health score trend, document 2 quantified
ROI data points, prepare 3 success plan status updates, know the renewal date,
brief your exec sponsor, identify one expansion opportunity (if Green health).

### Segment and tier CS coverage

| Tier | ARR range | Coverage model | CSM ratio | Touchpoint cadence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise | >$100K | Named CSM, white-glove, proactive | 1:10-20 | Bi-weekly syncs, quarterly EBRs |
| Mid-Market | $20K-$100K | Named CSM, pooled for scale | 1:40-80 | Monthly syncs, semi-annual EBRs |
| SMB / Long Tail | <$20K | Tech-touch: automated email, in-app, community | 1:200+ | Automated lifecycle sequences |

### Measure CS team performance - metrics

**Lagging metrics:**

| Metric | Definition | Target benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) | Revenue retained excluding expansion | >90% for SaaS |
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | Revenue retained including expansion, minus churn | >110% signals healthy growth |
| Logo Churn Rate | % of customers lost in a period | <5% annually |
| Renewal Rate | % of renewals closed on time | >95% |

**Leading metrics:**

| Metric | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Time-to-First-Value | Predicts long-term retention |
| Health Score Distribution | Portfolio risk visibility |
| QBR Completion Rate | Measures strategic engagement |
| Expansion Pipeline Coverage | Expansion predictability |

---

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Health score theater | Score exists in Salesforce but drives zero workflow | Tie every health band to a mandatory CSM action with SLA |
| One-size-fits-all coverage | Named CSMs on $5K accounts burns capacity; $500K accounts get neglected | Segment by ARR; build tech-touch for the long tail |
| Renewal-only QBRs | Signals the relationship is purely transactional | Run QBRs on a calendar cadence regardless of renewal timing |
| Premature expansion | Pitching upsells before first outcome produces churn, not revenue | Gate expansion on Green health (60+ days) and one achieved goal |
| Champion dependency | Single champion leaves and account collapses | Map at least two stakeholders; involve exec sponsor from onboarding |
| Vanity NPS | Sending surveys without acting on detractors | Close the loop on every detractor within 5 business days |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Health score with no action trigger is decoration** - A health score that lives in Salesforce and gets reviewed once a month during pipeline calls is not driving behavior. Every health band must have a mandatory CSM action with a defined SLA. Green without an expansion motion and Red without an escalation protocol are both failures of the system.

2. **Champion departure is not always visible in usage data** - Product usage can remain stable for 30-60 days after a champion leaves, because the remaining users keep using the product out of habit. The champion departure is a leading indicator that usage will decline. Monitor LinkedIn/CRM for job changes on key contacts, not just product telemetry.

3. **Premature expansion pitches accelerate churn** - Attempting to upsell a customer who has not yet achieved their primary success plan goals communicates that you care more about revenue than their outcomes. It damages trust, poisons renewal conversations, and produces contraction, not expansion. Gate expansion motions strictly on Green health for 60+ days and at least one documented ROI milestone.

4. **QBR attendance without executive preparation** - A QBR where the customer executive shows up cold (no agenda sent in advance, no pre-read, no briefing with the champion) quickly turns into a status update that could have been an email. Send the agenda and ROI data 5 business days in advance and pre-brief the champion on what you want the executive to walk away thinking.

5. **Onboarding completion measured by setup, not value** - Marking onboarding complete when technical setup is done (SSO configured, data imported) does not indicate the customer has achieved any business value. The real onboarding milestone is first value realization: a user has completed a meaningful workflow with real data and can demonstrate it unaided.
