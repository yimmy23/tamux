# Recruiting Operations

Recruiting operations is the structured practice of attracting, evaluating, and hiring
the right people efficiently and fairly. It spans the full talent acquisition lifecycle -
from defining the role through sourcing, screening, interviewing, and extending an offer.
This skill provides actionable frameworks for each phase: writing inclusive job
descriptions, building multi-channel sourcing strategies, designing structured screening
criteria, running calibrated interview loops, managing the offer process, tracking
pipeline metrics, and building employer brand. Built for hiring managers and recruiters
who want to move from ad-hoc hiring to a repeatable, data-informed, candidate-respecting
process.

---

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Needs to write or improve a job description for any role
- Wants to build or audit a sourcing strategy for a hard-to-fill position
- Is designing screening criteria, take-home exercises, or phone screen scripts
- Needs to structure an interview loop with defined stages and interviewer roles
- Is managing an offer, negotiating compensation, or closing a reluctant candidate
- Wants to measure recruiting funnel health with metrics like time-to-hire or offer acceptance rate
- Is building or improving employer brand, careers pages, or recruiting content
- Needs a scorecard, rubric, or calibration process for consistent candidate evaluation

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Performance management, PIPs, or managing underperforming employees (use people-ops or HR skill)
- Compensation benchmarking as a standalone exercise without a hiring context (use total-rewards skill)

---

## Key principles

1. **Structured process reduces bias** - Unstructured interviews measure confidence and
   likability, not job performance. Every hiring decision should rest on a defined
   scorecard with consistent signals evaluated the same way across all candidates.
   Standardize questions, calibrate interviewers, and separate data collection from
   evaluation to prevent halo effects and affinity bias.

2. **Speed is a competitive advantage** - The best candidates are off the market in
   7-14 days. Slow loops, delayed feedback, and scheduling gaps lose top talent to
   faster competitors. Measure time-in-stage, eliminate unnecessary interview rounds,
   and make offer decisions within 24 hours of a final interview.

3. **Sell while you evaluate** - Every touchpoint is a chance to lose or win a candidate.
   Interviewers who show up unprepared, ask hostile questions, or fail to explain the
   role's impact drive rejection rates up. Train every interviewer on the pitch: mission,
   team, growth path, and why this role matters now.

4. **Data-driven pipeline** - Track conversion rates at every funnel stage. If
   application-to-screen rate is high but screen-to-onsite is low, the phone screen is
   miscalibrated. If offer acceptance rate is below 80%, the offer or closing process
   is broken. Metrics tell you where the process leaks before it costs you headcount.

5. **Candidate experience matters** - Candidates who have a bad experience - ghosting,
   rude interviewers, confusing processes - become vocal detractors. Candidates who have
   a great experience become fans, even if not hired. Timely communication, clear
   expectations, and respectful feedback are the baseline.

## Core concepts

### Recruiting funnel

```
Sourced / Applied
      |
  Screened (resume + application review)
      |
  Phone / Video Screen
      |
  Technical / Skills Screen  (optional, role-dependent)
      |
  Onsite / Final Loop
      |
  Reference Check
      |
  Offer Extended
      |
  Offer Accepted
      |
  Day 1
```

Each stage has a target conversion rate. Deviation from baseline signals a broken
stage, not a broken candidate pool. Track volume and conversion at every gate.

### Sourcing channels

| Channel | Best for | Cost | Time to fill |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee referrals | Culture fit, passive candidates | Low | Fast |
| LinkedIn Recruiter | Senior / specialized roles | Medium | Medium |
| Job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Greenhouse) | High-volume, entry/mid-level | Low-Medium | Fast |
| Niche communities (Discord, Slack, forums) | Technical / domain-specific roles | Low | Slow |
| Recruiting agencies | Executive, urgent, highly specialized | High | Variable |
| GitHub / Dribbble / portfolio sites | Engineers, designers | Low | Slow |
| Conferences and meetups | Senior, passive, community-active talent | Medium | Slow |

**Sourcing rule:** Use at least three channels per role. Referrals should be one channel
but never the only channel - they homogenize the candidate pool.

### Screening criteria

A screening rubric must be defined before outreach begins. It contains:

- **Must-haves:** Hard requirements. Failing any disqualifies. Keep this list short (3-5 items).
- **Strong-to-haves:** Differentiating signals that raise conviction. Not disqualifying.
- **Anti-signals:** Patterns that suggest misalignment with the role or team.
- **Selling points:** What to emphasize to this candidate profile to drive conversion.

**Calibration rule:** Every must-have must be directly tied to a core job responsibility.
"5+ years of experience" is a proxy, not a criterion. Replace proxies with skills
or demonstrated behaviors wherever possible.

### Interview loops

An interview loop maps each competency to an interviewer and a set of defined questions.
No interviewer should evaluate a competency they were not assigned. No competency
should be left unassigned.

```
Loop design steps:
1. List 5-7 competencies required for success in the role.
2. Assign each competency to exactly one interviewer.
3. Write 3-5 behavioral or technical questions per competency.
4. Define what a strong, acceptable, and weak response looks like.
5. Hold a pre-loop calibration with all interviewers before the first candidate.
6. Hold a debrief within 24 hours of each loop. Collect written scores first,
   then discuss to prevent anchoring.
```

## Common tasks

### Write an inclusive job description

**Template structure:**

```
[ROLE TITLE]

About [Company]:
  2-3 sentences. Mission, stage, and what makes this team worth joining.
  Avoid superlatives ("best", "world-class"). Use specific, factual claims.

What you will do:
  5-7 bullet points. Focus on impact, not activities.
  Start each bullet with a verb: "Design", "Own", "Partner with", "Drive".
  At least one bullet should describe scope and autonomy.

What we are looking for:
  Must-haves: 3-5 items. Frame as skills or behaviors, not years of experience.
  Nice-to-haves: 2-3 items. Clearly labeled as optional.
  Do NOT include gender-coded language ("rockstar", "ninja", "dominant").

Compensation and benefits:
  State the salary range explicitly. Opacity signals disrespect.
  List equity, benefits, and any remote/hybrid/in-office policy.

How to apply:
  Clear next step. Timeline expectation. Who they will hear from.
```

**Inclusivity checklist before publishing:**
- Remove gendered language (run through a gender decoder tool)
- Eliminate jargon or acronyms without context
- List a salary range - candidates from underrepresented groups are less likely to apply
  without one
- Review the must-haves list: does every item directly predict job performance?
- Add an explicit accommodation statement for accessibility

See `references/job-description-templates.md` for engineering, product, and marketing
role templates.

### Build a sourcing strategy

**Channel selection by role type:**

```
Engineering (senior/staff):  LinkedIn Recruiter + GitHub + employee referrals + niche Slack/Discord
Engineering (entry/mid):     Job boards + university pipelines + bootcamp partnerships
Product:                     LinkedIn + referrals + product communities (Lenny's, MindTheProduct)
Design:                      Dribbble + Behance + LinkedIn + design communities
Marketing:                   LinkedIn + job boards + industry conferences
Sales:                       LinkedIn + referrals + SDR-specific job boards
```

**Outreach message structure:**

```
Subject: [Specific hook - why you are reaching out to them specifically]

Body:
  1. Why you reached out to THEM (reference their work, post, or project - be specific)
  2. What the role is in 1-2 sentences (company, team, problem they will work on)
  3. Why now (why this role matters at this stage of the company)
  4. One soft CTA: "Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation?"

Do NOT:
  - Use copy-paste templates with no personalization
  - Lead with "exciting opportunity" or "great culture"
  - Ask for a resume in the first message
  - Send follow-ups more than twice
```

**Referral program design:**
- Bonus amount: $1,000-$5,000 depending on role level, paid after 90-day cliff
- Notify the referrer at every stage transition, even if the candidate is rejected
- Close the loop: if you pass on a referral, tell the referrer why (at a high level)

### Design screening criteria

**Scorecard template:**

```
Role: [Title]
Hiring manager: [Name]
Date calibrated: [Date]

MUST-HAVES (disqualifying if absent):
  [ ] [Skill or behavior] - Evidence to look for: [specific signal]
  [ ] [Skill or behavior] - Evidence to look for: [specific signal]
  [ ] [Skill or behavior] - Evidence to look for: [specific signal]

STRONG-TO-HAVES (differentiating, not disqualifying):
  [ ] [Skill or behavior]
  [ ] [Skill or behavior]

ANTI-SIGNALS (not disqualifying alone, but raise concern):
  - [Pattern] - because [reason this predicts poor fit]
  - [Pattern] - because [reason this predicts poor fit]

SELLING POINTS FOR THIS CANDIDATE PROFILE:
  - [What to emphasize to convert this type of candidate]
```

**Calibration meeting agenda (30 min):**

1. Hiring manager walks through the must-haves and anti-signals (10 min)
2. Each interviewer states their assigned competencies and 2-3 key questions (15 min)
3. Agree on the debrief format and scoring scale (5 min)

### Create an interview loop

**Loop structure by role type:**

```
Engineering (IC):
  Stage 1 - Recruiter screen (30 min): motivation, logistics, high-level experience
  Stage 2 - Hiring manager screen (45 min): role fit, past projects, team dynamics
  Stage 3 - Technical assessment: take-home OR live coding (45-60 min)
  Stage 4 - Onsite loop (3-4 hours total):
    - Systems design / architecture (60 min)
    - Depth interview: past technical work (45 min)
    - Cross-functional collaboration (45 min)
    - Bar raiser / values interview (45 min)

Product Manager:
  Stage 1 - Recruiter screen (30 min)
  Stage 2 - Hiring manager screen (45 min)
  Stage 3 - Product exercise: written or live case study
  Stage 4 - Onsite loop:
    - Product sense and strategy (60 min)
    - Execution and metrics (45 min)
    - Leadership and influence (45 min)
    - Engineering / design partner interview (45 min)
```

**Interviewer assignment rules:**
- No interviewer does two back-to-back interviews with the same candidate (fatigue bias)
- At least one interviewer should be from a different team (bar raiser function)
- All interviewers receive the resume and scorecard 24 hours before the loop
- Debrief must happen within 24 hours; score independently before discussing

### Manage the offer process

**Offer timeline:**

```
Day 0:  Final debrief complete. Hiring decision made.
Day 1:  Verbal offer extended by hiring manager (not recruiter - signals importance).
        Cover: base, equity, bonus, start date, and one to two personalized selling points.
Day 1-2: Written offer letter sent within 24 hours of verbal acceptance.
Day 3-7: Candidate decision window. Check in once at midpoint.
Day 7+:  If no decision, ask directly: "Is there anything preventing you from deciding?"
```

**Comp structure to communicate:**

```
Base salary:      $[range]. Explain where they land in band and why.
Equity:           [shares or %]. Explain vesting schedule, cliff, and current valuation context.
Bonus:            [target %]. Explain how it is calculated and historical payout.
Benefits:         Health, dental, vision, 401k match, PTO policy. List specifics, not "competitive".
Start date:       Propose a date; leave room to negotiate.
Offer expiration: 5-7 business days. Shorter creates pressure; longer delays close.
```

**Closing tactics for reluctant candidates:**

1. Identify the real hesitation - ask directly, do not assume it is compensation
2. Arrange a call with the hiring manager or a peer they connected with in the loop
3. Share a specific example of growth or impact from a current team member
4. If competing offer exists: do not get into a bidding war on unknown numbers; ask to
   see the competing offer before matching or beating it
5. Know your walk-away: if the candidate needs more than a 10-15% comp adjustment to
   accept, re-examine whether they are the right hire

### Track recruiting metrics

**Core funnel metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Time-to-fill | Offer acceptance date - req open date | < 45 days (IC), < 90 days (exec) |
| Time-to-hire | Offer acceptance date - first application | < 30 days |
| Offer acceptance rate | Offers accepted / offers extended | > 80% |
| Pipeline conversion rate | Stage N+1 / Stage N | Varies by stage (see below) |
| Source-to-hire | Hires by source / total hires | Track to optimize channel spend |
| Interview-to-offer ratio | Onsites completed / offers extended | < 3:1 |
| Quality of hire | Performance score at 6 months | Manager-defined; track cohort |

**Stage conversion benchmarks (engineering roles):**

```
Sourced / Applied  ->  Screened:           20-30%
Screened           ->  Phone screen:       30-50%
Phone screen       ->  Onsite:             30-50%
Onsite             ->  Offer:              25-40%
Offer              ->  Accepted:           > 80%
```

**Dashboard checklist:**
- Reqs open by team and age
- Active candidates per stage per req
- Week-over-week pipeline change (growing / shrinking / stalled)
- Source breakdown for current quarter
- Time-in-stage heatmap (where candidates get stuck)

### Build employer brand

**Core assets:**

```
Careers page:
  - Team photos and short videos (authentic, not over-produced)
  - Engineering blog or Notion page with technical writing
  - "A day in the life" content for key roles
  - Explicit statement on remote/hybrid/in-office
  - Transparent salary bands (or at minimum, a public pay philosophy)

Glassdoor / Blind:
  - Respond to all reviews - positive and negative - within 2 weeks
  - Do not argue with negative reviews; acknowledge and explain what changed
  - Encourage current employees to leave honest reviews (never fake or coerced)

Conference and community presence:
  - Engineers speaking at relevant conferences signals technical credibility
  - Sponsoring niche communities (Discord, Slack groups) drives passive awareness
  - Open source contributions show culture and work quality
```

**Content cadence:**

| Channel | Frequency | Content type |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn company page | 2-3x/week | Hiring announcements, team wins, culture moments |
| Engineering blog | 1-2x/month | Technical deep-dives, architecture decisions, post-mortems |
| Twitter/X | 3-5x/week | Quick takes, behind-the-scenes, team shoutouts |
| Glassdoor response | Within 2 weeks | Response to each new review |

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it is wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Writing job descriptions as a wish list | A 15-bullet must-haves list discourages strong candidates (especially women) and fills the funnel with poor fits | Limit must-haves to 3-5 directly job-relevant criteria; move everything else to nice-to-haves |
| Unstructured interviews ("tell me about yourself") | Measures charisma and communication style, not job-relevant competencies; introduces significant bias | Define competencies, assign them to interviewers, and use behavioral questions with a scoring rubric |
| Ghosting rejected candidates | Damages employer brand; candidates remember and share bad experiences publicly | Send rejections within 5 business days of a decision; personalize the message for candidates who reached onsite |
| Slow offer process (> 5 days from decision to verbal offer) | Top candidates accept competing offers; every day of delay is lost pipeline | Pre-align on comp band and approval chain before the loop; make the verbal offer within 24 hours of the debrief |
| Single-channel sourcing (only LinkedIn or only referrals) | Homogenizes the candidate pool; creates blind spots in diversity and skill coverage | Activate at least three channels per req; review source diversity quarterly |
| Collecting interview feedback verbally only | Anchoring bias: the loudest voice in the debrief shapes everyone else's recall | Require written scorecards submitted before the debrief meeting begins |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Must-haves list growing during the hiring process** - Hiring managers add requirements after seeing candidates, retroactively raising the bar in ways that weren't calibrated. Lock the must-haves list before the first screen and treat post-calibration changes as scope creep requiring explicit sign-off.

2. **Debrief discussion before written scores submitted** - The loudest voice in the debrief anchors everyone else's recall. Require all interviewers to submit written scorecards independently before the debrief call begins. This is the highest-impact structural change for reducing bias.

3. **Verbal offer extended by recruiter instead of hiring manager** - A verbal offer delivered by a recruiter signals the role is transactional. The hiring manager extending the offer personally signals the candidate matters. This is especially important for senior hires and competitive situations.

4. **Competing offer handled by guessing at the number** - When a candidate has a competing offer, matching or beating an unknown number is a negotiation mistake. Ask to see the competing offer before responding. Counter on total value (equity, growth, mission), not just base salary.

5. **Referral pipeline used as the primary or only channel** - Employee referrals produce fast, culturally similar hires, but relying on them exclusively homogenizes the team. Use referrals as one of at least three channels; audit source diversity quarterly.
