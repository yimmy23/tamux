# Social Media Strategy

Social media strategy is the discipline of planning, creating, distributing, and
measuring content across platforms to build an audience, grow a brand, and drive
measurable outcomes. The core insight is that every platform has its own culture,
algorithm, and audience behavior - a strategy that treats them identically will
fail all of them. Effective social media work combines platform-native content
craft with data-driven iteration and genuine community engagement.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks to build or audit a social media strategy for a brand or personal account
- Needs to create a content calendar or posting schedule
- Wants platform-specific post copy (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Asks how to grow organic reach or followers without paid ads
- Wants to increase engagement (comments, shares, saves, click-throughs)
- Needs to analyze social media metrics and draw conclusions
- Asks how to build or manage an online community
- Needs to handle a PR crisis or negative viral moment on social

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Paid advertising campaign setup (Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads) - that is performance
  marketing, not organic social strategy
- Technical platform integrations or API work (scheduling tool APIs, webhook setup)

## Key principles

1. **Platform-native content** - Every platform has a distinct format, tone, and
   culture. Content native to LinkedIn feels formal and professional; content native
   to TikTok is casual, fast, and trend-aware. Repurposing without adapting is a
   strategy for mediocrity. Reformat, re-tone, and re-angle for each platform.

2. **Consistency over frequency** - Posting every day for two weeks and disappearing
   does more damage than posting three times a week forever. Algorithms reward
   consistent, reliable publishers. Choose a cadence that is sustainable at 90%
   output quality, then hold it.

3. **Engage, don't broadcast** - Social media is not a press release channel. Brands
   that only push content and never reply, share, or comment are talking at their
   audience. Engagement begets engagement - reply to every comment in the first hour,
   engage with peer accounts, and participate in conversations you didn't start.

4. **Data-driven iteration** - Intuition starts the strategy; data improves it.
   Track which content pillars, formats, and posting times produce the best reach
   and engagement, then double down. Kill formats that consistently underperform
   after 30 days of fair testing.

5. **80/20 value-to-promotion** - At least 80% of content should educate, entertain,
   or inspire. At most 20% should directly promote a product, service, or CTA.
   Audiences follow accounts that give them something; they unfollow accounts that
   only sell to them.

## Core concepts

**Algorithm signals** are the behavioral inputs platforms use to decide how widely
to distribute a post. Common signals include watch time (video), saves and shares
(Instagram), dwell time (LinkedIn), replies (X), and early-hour engagement velocity
(most platforms). Understanding what each algorithm rewards is the foundation of
distribution strategy.

**Content pillars** are 3-5 thematic categories that define what an account talks
about. Pillars give a content calendar structure, ensure variety, and signal to the
algorithm what the account is "about." A SaaS startup might have pillars: product
education, founder story, industry insight, customer success, and culture.

**Engagement metrics** measure how the audience interacts with content. Reach and
impressions are vanity metrics; engagement rate, saves, shares, and click-through
rate are signal metrics. A post with 1,000 impressions and 80 saves outperforms a
post with 10,000 impressions and 5 saves in most algorithms.

**Platform demographics** determine where your audience actually is. LinkedIn skews
professional (25-45, B2B buyers, career climbers). Instagram skews visual-first
(18-35, lifestyle, consumer brands). X skews tech, media, and commentary. TikTok
skews Gen Z but has expanded significantly into 25-40. Match platform to audience,
not habit.

## Common tasks

### Build a platform strategy

Define goals, audience, and per-platform tactics before creating any content.

**Step 1 - Set one primary goal per platform.** Platforms serve different business
objectives. Don't try to do everything everywhere.

| Platform | Best for | Primary metric |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | B2B leads, hiring, thought leadership | Profile views, DM volume, post impressions |
| X (Twitter) | Brand voice, real-time commentary, developer/tech community | Follower growth, engagement rate, mentions |
| Instagram | Visual brand, product discovery, lifestyle | Reach, saves, story replies, link clicks |
| TikTok | Top-of-funnel awareness, entertainment, Gen Z reach | Views, follower growth, shares |
| YouTube | Long-form education, SEO, product demos | Watch time, subscribers, click-through rate |

**Step 2 - Define 3-5 content pillars** that map to audience needs and business goals.

**Step 3 - Audit current performance** using native analytics. Identify what already
works and what can be cut.

**Step 4 - Set a content cadence** per platform and assign formats (carousel, reel,
thread, etc.) to each pillar.

**Step 5 - Define a measurement cadence** - weekly snapshots, monthly deep dives.

### Create a content calendar

A content calendar prevents scrambling and ensures pillar balance.

1. Map pillars to days of the week (e.g., Monday = education, Wednesday = culture,
   Friday = industry insight).
2. For each slot, specify: platform, pillar, format, topic idea, CTA, and publish
   time (aligned to when your specific audience is online - check native analytics).
3. Build 2-3 weeks of content in advance. Never fall below one week ahead.
4. Leave one unscheduled slot per week for reactive/trending content.
5. Review and replan monthly based on what the data showed.

### Write platform-specific posts

Each platform requires a different structure. Use these formats as starting points.

**LinkedIn post format:**
```
[Hook - one bold sentence, no more than 12 words]

[2-4 short paragraphs, each 1-3 lines. Personal story or concrete insight.
No jargon. Write like you're talking to a smart peer, not a boardroom.]

[Optional: numbered list or bullet points for scannable takeaways]

[Soft CTA or open question to invite comments]

[3-5 hashtags at the bottom, not inline]
```

**X (Twitter) thread format:**
```
Tweet 1 (hook): [Bold contrarian claim or surprising statistic]

Tweet 2-8: [One insight per tweet. Short punchy sentences. Each tweet
stands alone but rewards reading the full thread.]

Tweet N (close): [Summary or concrete takeaway]
[Reply to tweet 1 with a link to go deeper - blog, product, newsletter]
```

**Instagram caption format:**
```
[First line hook - visible before "more" cutoff, max 125 characters]

[Body - story, context, or educational content. 150-300 words for reach.
Use line breaks liberally. Break every 2-3 sentences.]

[CTA: "Save this for later" / "Tag someone who needs this" / "Link in bio"]

[5-15 hashtags: mix of niche (10K-100K posts), medium (100K-1M), and
broad (1M+). Put them after 3-4 blank lines or in first comment.]
```

### Grow organic reach

Organic reach is earned through algorithm alignment and network effects.

- **Post in the engagement window:** Reply to every comment within the first 60
  minutes. Early engagement velocity is the strongest signal on most platforms.
- **Use format variety:** Mix carousels, short video, text posts, and polls.
  Platforms promote formats they are actively pushing (check platform news).
- **Collaborate:** Co-create content with adjacent accounts. Tags and mentions
  extend reach into new audiences at no cost.
- **Write strong hooks:** 80% of users decide whether to stop scrolling in the
  first 1-2 seconds (video) or first line (text). Invest disproportionate effort
  here.
- **Post consistently at the same times:** Algorithms learn your cadence and begin
  pre-distributing to your audience when they expect new content from you.

### Build community engagement

Community is what separates a following from an audience that acts.

1. **Respond to every comment** for the first 30 days of a campaign or new account.
   This trains the algorithm and the audience that you are present.
2. **Ask questions** in captions and posts that are genuinely easy to answer in
   1-2 sentences. Complex questions get ignored.
3. **Feature community members** - reshare user-generated content, reply publicly
   to thoughtful comments, give credit visibly.
4. **Create recurring formats** (e.g., "Friday wins," "Monday tip") that audiences
   can anticipate and engage with ritualistically.
5. **Go off-platform strategically** - use social to funnel engaged followers into
   an owned channel (email list, Discord, Slack community) where the algorithm
   cannot throttle the relationship.

### Analyze and report on metrics

A monthly social media report should answer four questions:

1. **What was the reach?** Total impressions, unique accounts reached, follower
   delta. Are we growing the top of the funnel?
2. **What drove engagement?** Engagement rate by post, format, and pillar. What
   content resonated? What missed?
3. **What drove action?** Link clicks, profile visits, DMs, story replies, saves.
   Are we moving people toward a business outcome?
4. **What do we do next month differently?** Explicit data-backed decisions: kill
   one low-performing format, double one high-performing pillar, test one new format.

Key benchmarks (industry averages, vary by account size):
- Instagram engagement rate: 1-3% healthy, 3-6% strong, 6%+ exceptional
- LinkedIn engagement rate: 2-5% healthy for organic posts
- X engagement rate: 0.5-1% is average; 2%+ is strong for accounts over 10K

### Handle crisis communications on social

When a brand faces backlash, negative viral content, or a PR incident:

1. **Pause scheduled content immediately.** Tone-deaf promotional posts during a
   crisis accelerate damage.
2. **Assess scope within 30 minutes.** Is this isolated criticism or genuinely
   viral? Check volume of mentions, sentiment, and whether media is picking it up.
3. **Acknowledge, don't defend.** The first response should show you have heard the
   concern - even before you have an answer. "We are aware of [X] and taking it
   seriously. We will update here shortly."
4. **Respond with facts, not feelings.** If the criticism is factually incorrect,
   correct the record calmly with evidence. If it is valid, acknowledge and explain
   the remedy.
5. **Move resolution off-platform** when possible. "Please DM us" or "email us at
   [support]" - this limits public escalation while still signaling responsiveness.
6. **Post a resolution update** once the issue is addressed. Close the loop publicly.
7. **Conduct a post-mortem.** What triggered this? What could have been caught
   earlier? Update content review processes.

## Gotchas

1. **LinkedIn penalizes external links in the post body** - Posts that include a URL in the body text get significantly reduced organic reach on LinkedIn. Post the link as the first comment and reference it in the caption ("link in first comment") to preserve reach.

2. **Instagram hashtag strategy inverted from what it used to be** - More hashtags (30) no longer improves reach and may suppress distribution. Instagram's current guidance is 3-5 highly relevant hashtags. Over-hashtagging is now a negative signal, not a neutral one.

3. **Scheduling tools can delay posting windows by 5-30 minutes** - Native posting at peak time outperforms scheduled posting because platform algorithms weight early engagement velocity. A post scheduled for 9:00 AM that goes live at 9:18 AM misses the peak window. For high-priority posts, post natively or verify your scheduler's actual publish time.

4. **Engagement baiting violates platform policies and reduces reach** - Phrases like "tag a friend who needs this" or "double tap if you agree" are classified as engagement bait by Facebook and Instagram algorithms and result in suppressed distribution. Ask genuine questions instead.

5. **Crisis pause must include ad campaigns, not just organic posts** - When pausing scheduled content during a PR crisis, ad campaigns (boosted posts, dark posts) often continue running independently. Failing to pause paid promotion during a brand crisis accelerates negative sentiment at your own expense.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Copy-paste cross-posting | The same caption on LinkedIn and Instagram ignores audience, format, and algorithm differences - it underperforms everywhere | Adapt each post natively for the platform it lives on |
| Chasing vanity metrics | Follower count and raw impressions do not predict business outcomes | Track saves, shares, DM volume, and link clicks - behaviors that signal intent |
| Posting without a hook | The first line or frame determines whether anyone reads the rest; generic openers ("Today I want to talk about...") bleed reach | Draft the hook last, after you know the core insight, and make it impossible to ignore |
| Inconsistent cadence | Algorithms penalize accounts that go dark; audiences forget you exist | Choose a sustainable posting frequency first, then increase as systems improve |
| Hashtag stuffing | 30 broad hashtags on Instagram or 10 on LinkedIn signals spam and reduces distribution | Use 5-15 targeted hashtags on Instagram; 3-5 on LinkedIn; 1-3 on X |
| Ignoring the comments | Comments are the highest-signal engagement event; ignoring them tells the algorithm the post is low quality | Block calendar time daily to respond to every comment within 2 hours of posting |
