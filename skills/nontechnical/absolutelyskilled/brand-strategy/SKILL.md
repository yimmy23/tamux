# Brand Strategy

Brand strategy is the long-term plan for developing a brand's identity, positioning,
and perception in the market. It answers three fundamental questions: who we are,
who we are for, and why we matter. A strong brand strategy gives every piece of
communication - from a product UI to a tweet to a sales deck - a consistent,
recognizable character. This skill covers the full brand strategy toolkit: positioning
statements, brand voice and tone, messaging hierarchy, brand archetypes, brand
storytelling, competitive mapping, and brand audits.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Wants to write or rewrite a brand positioning statement
- Needs to define or document brand voice and tone guidelines
- Is building a messaging hierarchy or messaging framework
- Wants to develop a brand story or origin narrative
- Is mapping competitive positioning in a market
- Needs to choose or define a brand archetype
- Is creating or reviewing a brand guidelines document
- Wants to audit brand consistency across channels

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Visual design decisions (logo, color palette, typography) - those are brand identity
  execution, not strategy; use a design or UI skill
- Content calendar planning or social media scheduling - use a content marketing skill

## Key principles

1. **Positioning is a choice, not a description** - A positioning statement does not
   describe what your product does; it stakes a claim. The claim requires an enemy -
   the alternative your audience currently accepts. Without contrast there is no
   position.

2. **Consistency builds trust** - A brand that sounds different in every channel is
   not a brand, it is a collection of messages. Audiences build trust through
   repetition. Repeat the same core idea in different contexts, not different ideas.

3. **Voice is personality - tone adapts to context** - Voice is who you are (always
   the same). Tone is how you express it given the situation (changes with context).
   A confident brand still adjusts tone from celebratory in a launch email to calm
   and direct in an incident report.

4. **Simple beats complex** - The best brand strategies fit on one page. If you need
   ten slides to explain your positioning, you do not have a position. Ruthlessly
   edit until a stranger can repeat your core idea after hearing it once.

5. **Brand is a promise kept** - Strategy documents are worthless if the product,
   support, and people do not deliver on what the brand claims. The strongest brand
   asset is consistent experience. Every brand touchpoint is a vote for or against
   the promise.

## Core concepts

**Brand pyramid** is the hierarchy from functional attributes at the base to emotional
benefits and brand character at the top. The base is "what it does," the middle is
"what that means for me," and the peak is "who I am when I use this." Messaging flows
down from the peak - lead with the peak, support with the base.

**Positioning statement** is a structured one-sentence claim that names the target
audience, the category the brand competes in, the key benefit, and the reason to
believe. It is an internal working document - not ad copy - used to align the team.
See the common tasks section for the template.

**Brand archetype** is the character the brand embodies, drawn from twelve universal
archetypes (Innocent, Hero, Outlaw, Caregiver, Explorer, Sage, etc.). Archetypes
give teams a shorthand for voice, visual, and narrative decisions. See
`references/brand-frameworks.md` for the full catalog.

**Messaging hierarchy** organizes all brand messages into three levels: the primary
message (one sentence, the umbrella claim), the supporting messages (three to five
proofs that back the primary claim), and the proof points (specific facts, metrics,
or stories that back each supporting message).

**Brand equity** is the commercial value derived from consumer perception of the
brand name. It is built through awareness (people know you exist), associations
(people connect you with specific values), perceived quality, and loyalty. Positioning
and voice strategy are the primary inputs to building brand equity.

## Common tasks

### Write a positioning statement

Use the Geoffrey Moore template, the most battle-tested positioning structure:

```
For [target customer]
who [has this need or problem],
[Brand name] is the [market category]
that [key benefit / differentiated claim].
Unlike [primary alternative or competitor],
[Brand name] [key differentiator].
```

**Example - productivity app:**
```
For remote engineering teams
who lose hours to fragmented async communication,
Streamline is the project coordination platform
that replaces meetings with structured decision threads.
Unlike Slack, which is built for chat,
Streamline is built for decisions.
```

**Rules for a strong positioning statement:**
- Target customer must be specific enough to exclude someone
- Category should be a real, understood category (do not invent one)
- Key benefit must be a measurable or concrete outcome - not a feeling
- Differentiator must be something competitors cannot honestly claim
- Write five versions before committing to one

### Define brand voice and tone

**Framework: four voice dimensions**

Define the brand's voice across four dimensions. For each, write a one-sentence
description and two "we are / we are not" pairs.

| Dimension | Definition | We Are | We Are Not |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personality | The character the brand embodies | - | - |
| Vocabulary | The words and register we use | - | - |
| Rhythm | How sentences feel - long/short, formal/casual | - | - |
| Perspective | The point of view and worldview we write from | - | - |

**Example - developer tool brand:**

| Dimension | We Are | We Are Not |
|---|---|---|
| Personality | Direct and technically confident | Jargon-heavy or condescending |
| Vocabulary | Plain English, precise technical terms when needed | Marketing fluff, buzzwords |
| Rhythm | Short sentences. Active voice. No wasted words. | Long paragraphs, passive constructions |
| Perspective | Engineer-to-engineer, builder to builder | Company talking at customer |

**Tone adaptations by channel:**

| Context | Tone shift |
|---|---|
| Marketing headline | Punchy, bold, provocative |
| Onboarding email | Warm, encouraging, clear |
| Error message | Calm, factual, actionable |
| Incident report | Direct, no hedging, take ownership |
| Social media | Conversational, a degree more playful |

---

### Build messaging hierarchy

**Three-level structure:**

```
PRIMARY MESSAGE (1 sentence)
The single umbrella claim. Everything else serves this.

SUPPORTING MESSAGES (3-5 sentences)
Each one proves a different facet of the primary message.
Each one should stand alone as credible.

PROOF POINTS (2-3 per supporting message)
Concrete facts, metrics, case studies, or quotes.
These are the evidence layer.
```

**Example:**

```
PRIMARY: "Streamline cuts engineering meeting time by 80% without losing alignment."

SUPPORTING 1: Teams make faster decisions because context travels with the work.
  - Proof: Decision threads attach directly to PRs and tasks
  - Proof: Average decision cycle dropped from 3.2 days to 0.8 days (beta data)

SUPPORTING 2: Async-first means everyone participates, not just the loudest voice.
  - Proof: Voting and comment threads replace live debate
  - Proof: 94% of users report feeling more heard than in previous tools

SUPPORTING 3: It replaces three tools, not adds a fourth.
  - Proof: Integrates with GitHub, Jira, and Notion - not a new silo
  - Proof: Average team removes 2.1 other communication tools after adopting
```

### Create brand storytelling

**Hero's journey adapted for brand narratives:**

The brand is never the hero. The customer is the hero. The brand is the guide.

| Story stage | Brand role | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary world | Acknowledge the status quo | "Before, teams were stuck doing X" |
| Call to adventure | Name the problem worth solving | "Then we realized X was causing Y loss" |
| Mentor appears | Brand enters as guide | "We built [brand] because we had the same problem" |
| Crossing the threshold | Customer takes first step | "When teams try [brand], they first notice..." |
| Tests and trials | Honest acknowledgment of friction | "Getting started takes 30 minutes..." |
| Reward | The transformation | "Three months in, teams report..." |
| Return with elixir | Customer becomes a case study | "[Customer name] now ships 2x faster" |

**Founding story structure (for About pages):**

```
1. The founder's specific, personal problem (2-3 sentences)
2. The moment they realized it was a universal problem (1-2 sentences)
3. What they tried before building their own solution (1-2 sentences)
4. The insight that made the product different (1-2 sentences)
5. The result and who benefits (2-3 sentences)
```

### Competitive positioning map

Plot competitors on a 2x2 matrix using two axes that represent meaningful trade-offs
in your category. The goal is to find a position of clear, defensible whitespace.

**How to select axes:**
- Choose axes that real customers use to evaluate products in the category
- Avoid axes where everyone clusters (e.g., "quality" vs "price" maps are useless)
- Use axes that represent genuine strategic trade-offs

**Example axes for a project management tool:**
- X axis: Simplicity (low) to Power/Flexibility (high)
- Y axis: Individual-focused (low) to Team/Enterprise-focused (high)

After mapping, answer: Is our intended position genuinely empty? If not, what claim
can we make that shifts the axes in our favor?

### Develop brand guidelines document

**Minimum viable brand guidelines structure:**

1. **Brand promise** - one sentence: what we deliver to every customer, every time
2. **Positioning statement** - the Moore template filled in
3. **Target audience** - two to three personas with a name, job, and core frustration
4. **Brand archetype** - which of the twelve, with three behavioral implications
5. **Voice and tone** - four dimensions with "we are / we are not" examples
6. **Messaging hierarchy** - primary message, three to five supporting messages
7. **Vocabulary guide** - words we use, words we never use, words to use carefully
8. **Channel tone adaptations** - how voice shifts for each major channel

**Rules for guidelines documents:**
- Every guideline needs an example - abstract principles without examples are unused
- Include "do this / not this" pairs for voice and vocabulary
- Keep it under 15 pages or no one will read it
- Version it - brand guidelines evolve as the company learns

---

### Audit brand consistency

Evaluate brand consistency across channels against these five dimensions:

| Dimension | Audit question | Red flag |
|---|---|---|
| Voice | Does copy across website, email, and social sound like the same entity? | Formal on website, slangy on social with no intentional shift |
| Message | Is the primary brand claim present and consistent everywhere? | Different value props on homepage vs sales deck vs LinkedIn |
| Positioning | Are we consistently placed in the right category? | Sometimes "project management," sometimes "communication tool" |
| Audience | Does the targeting feel consistent? | Website targets SMBs; ads target enterprise; blog targets developers |
| Promise | Does the product experience deliver what the brand claims? | Brand claims "simplicity" but onboarding takes 3 hours |

**Audit scoring:** Rate each dimension 1-5. Any dimension at 3 or below needs a
defined fix with an owner and deadline. Do not audit without a plan to act on findings.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Positioning to everyone | "For anyone who wants to be more productive" is not a position - it is the absence of one; it is impossible to win a fight you have not chosen | Name a specific, narrow customer and an explicit competitor or alternative; whittle until someone can be excluded |
| Brand voice = formal language | Formal language is not professional - it is distant; it creates the illusion of authority without building trust | Use the language your best customers use when talking about their problem at dinner, not in a press release |
| Archetype as costume | Picking "Rebel" then writing safe, committee-approved copy; archetype is skin-deep if the team does not actually behave consistently with it | Derive two or three concrete behavioral decisions from the archetype before approving it |
| Updating positioning on every bad quarter | Brand equity requires repetition; changing positioning when conversion dips destroys accumulated associations | Investigate conversion problems at the channel/offer level before touching positioning; give positioning at least 18 months |
| Message house with no hierarchy | A list of six equally weighted messages is not a hierarchy - it is a features list; audiences cannot hold six messages | One primary message owns everything; all other messages support and prove the primary |
| Brand guidelines as decoration | A 60-page PDF no one reads does not create brand consistency - it creates the illusion of it | Short guidelines, mandatory examples, assigned owners for each channel, and a quarterly review cadence |

---

## Gotchas

1. **Positioning that tries to win everyone wins no one** - The most common failure: a positioning statement so broad it excludes no competitor and excludes no customer. "For businesses that want to grow" is not a position. Without a specific audience and an explicit alternative being rejected, there's no position to defend.

2. **Voice guidelines without examples are ignored** - A voice attribute like "conversational and direct" means different things to every writer. Without a "write this, not this" example pair for each attribute, different team members will interpret the same guideline completely differently. Every voice guideline needs at least one concrete before/after example.

3. **Changing positioning after 6 months wipes accumulated brand equity** - Repositioning feels necessary when early conversion numbers are disappointing, but the problem is usually channel execution, not positioning. Brand associations take 12-18+ months of consistent repetition to form. Diagnose at the campaign/offer level before touching the positioning statement.

4. **Brand archetype selection without behavioral commitments is cosmetic** - Teams choose "The Sage" or "The Rebel" and then write the same safe, committee-approved copy they would have written anyway. An archetype is only useful if it generates 2-3 concrete behavioral commitments - things the brand will do or won't do - that are different from the default.

5. **Messaging hierarchy with 6+ equal-weight messages is a feature list** - If all messages are weighted equally, audiences can't identify the main point and the brand says nothing memorable. One message must be primary (the umbrella claim); everything else exists to support and prove it, not to compete with it.
