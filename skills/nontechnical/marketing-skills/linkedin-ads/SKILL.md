----|------|
| **Campaign group** | Groups related programs; shared **status and budgets** (optional). |
| **Campaign** | **Marketing objective**; budget/scheduling as configured. |
| **Ad set** | **Accelerate** or **Classic**; **audience, placements, format, budget, schedule, bid**; conversion/URL params. [Compare types](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a1642380) |
| **Ads** | Creative; multiple ads per ad set for A/B. |

**Billing model**: [Objective-based pricing](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a427513) — **billed on the action tied to the objective** (e.g. clicks for traffic-oriented objectives). [Pricing overview](https://business.linkedin.com/advertise/ads/pricing)

**Budget pacing**: Auction-based; on **daily** budgets, spend on a day may **exceed the daily number by a margin**; **pacing** smooths so **7-day** spend does not exceed about **7× daily** (per LinkedIn’s public budget article—**always** confirm the latest text). [Budgets and pacing](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a422101)

**Minimum spend**: There is **no one global fixed** minimum across all cases; very low daily/lifetime budgets are often **rejected in UI**. A common **practical** floor cited in the industry is on the order of **~$10 USD/day per ad set** (not a platform guarantee). Use Campaign Manager as source of truth.

## Ad formats and placements (high level)

[Ads Guide (authoritative for specs)](https://business.linkedin.com/advertise/ads/ads-guide)

### Sponsored Content (feed and related)

Aligns with **organic** shapes in **linkedin-posts** (image, video, document, etc.) as **paid** delivery:

- **Single image, video, carousel** (carousel ad cards often **2–10** in guide) · **Document** (PDF/DOC/PPT-style; large page/file limits in guide)
- **Event** ads (promote a LinkedIn Event) · **Job** ads (boost an existing job post)
- **Thought Leader** ads: amplify **qualified** members’ posts (eligibility rules in Ads Guide)
- **Article and Newsletter** ads: promote in-platform long-form/series
- **CTV (Connected TV)**: in-stream **reach**-oriented video with LinkedIn **targeting**; not a feed click campaign by default
- Placements can include **LinkedIn Audience Network (LAN)**—third-party app/site inventory. Toggle/availability is in the ad set. [LAN (help)](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a423409)

### Lead Gen Forms

- Native forms on ads; **profile pre-fill**; typically **~12 fields and ~3 custom questions** at most (verify current product)
- Minimize fields for higher completion; sync to CRM/Marketing automation

### Sponsored Messaging (inbox)

| Type | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **Message Ads** | One focused **message** + CTA; body often **~1,500 characters** in product docs (check Ads Guide) |
| **Conversation Ads** | **Branching** buttons; long body allowance (often **~8,000 characters** in docs); **up to ~5 CTA** buttons (check guide) |

### Text and Dynamic Ads

- **Text ads**: **Desktop**-oriented; small image + text; often CPC/CPM. [Placements (help)](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a417880)
- **Dynamic / Follower / Spotlight** variants: personalized right-rail; see Ads Guide

**Tracking**

- **Insight Tag** for site retargeting and conversion lift · [Conversion tracking hub](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a420536)
- **UTM/URL parameters**: [URL tracking parameters](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a5968064)

## Targeting strengths

| Signal | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **Job title, function, seniority** | ICP and committees |
| **Company** | Industry, size, name lists (ABM) |
| **Skills, interests, groups** | Technical or topical |
| **Matched Audiences** | **Contact/company** lists, retargeting (Insight Tag) |
| **Exclusions, expansion** | **Audience expansion** (when offered)—broaden carefully |

**Lookalike audiences**: As of current LinkedIn public documentation, **Lookalike** is **not** the default expansion path; it has been **deprecated/removed** in many accounts—rely on **first-party lists**, **Matched Audiences**, and **exclusion/expansion** options shown in the UI. See [Target audience size / practices](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a423690) and the live Campaign Manager for your tenant.

**Principle**: LinkedIn is **expensive**; start **narrow, high-intent**; then scale with measured expansion.

**Audience size**: A common **operational** band mentioned in industry is **hundreds+** in targetable size; the UI will warn if the audience is too small—follow it.

## Creative best practices

- **Professional** tone; align Sponsored copy with your **Page** and organic voice (**linkedin-posts**)
- **Headline + first line** clear value; match landing experience
- **Lead Gen Forms**: **fewer** fields; clear next step for SDRs
- **Document ads**: gating a PDF/deck; pair with a strong CTA
- **Creative limits**: e.g. image **~5MB** and **~1200×627** in many specs—**always** take from [Ads Guide](https://business.linkedin.com/advertise/ads/ads-guide) for the format you use

## Benchmark costs (illustrative, not guaranteed)

- LinkedIn is typically **higher** **CPC/CPM** than Meta and Google in comparable B2B use cases. Third-party **ranges** (USD, very rough) often cite e.g. **CPC ~$5–8** as a **ballpark** middle; real costs swing with audience, **CTR**, **quality**, and season. **Never** use these as a commitment—use in-account reporting. [Why pricing varies](https://business.linkedin.com/advertise/ads/pricing)
- **CTR** for feed is often **well under ~1%** in reported benchmarks; optimize creative and ICP, not the benchmark alone

## Bidding (short)

- Start with **strategies** appropriate to the objective; move to **automated/goal-based** when **enough** weekly conversions exist for the system to learn
- Manual caps help when **volume** is too low to automate

## Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] **Insight Tag** (if site conversions/retargeting) · **Lead** routing to CRM if using LGF
- [ ] **Page** and billing **ready**; **naming** at group/campaign/ad set level
- [ ] **Objective** and **ad set** type (**Accelerate** vs **Classic**) set intentionally
- [ ] **Audience** defined; **exclusions** for existing customers (where needed)
- [ ] **Creatives** meet policy; **UTMs** for non-LGF web flows
- [ ] **Budget** realistic for the account’s CPM/CPC; **pacing** understood

## Related Skills

- **linkedin-posts**: Organic formats and copy; align Sponsored with same patterns
- **paid-ads-strategy**: Channel mix; B2B vs B2C; budget allocation
- **landing-page-generator**: Web LPs for non–Lead Gen Form flows
