# Science Skills

[![Install via skills.sh](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills.sh-install-green)](https://skills.sh/google-deepmind/science-skills)

A collection of agent skills for scientific research tasks, spanning genomics,
structural biology, cheminformatics, literature search, and more.

Each skill provides structured instructions, scripts, and resources that extend
an AI agent's capabilities for specialized scientific tasks.

## Skill Structure

Each skill directory contains:

-   **SKILL.md** — Main instruction file with YAML frontmatter and detailed
    markdown instructions
-   **scripts/** — Helper scripts and utilities
-   **references/** — Additional documentation and references (optional)

## Getting started with GDM Science Skills

Install the Science Skills bundle via
[npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx) using:

```bash
npx skills add google-deepmind/science-skills/
```

## Using science skills with [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)

If you're a new Google Antigravity user:

-   Launch the application after downloading Google Antigravity and check the
    box for Science at the 'Build with Google' step - this will install the
    curated collection of our Science Skills.

If you're an existing Google Antigravity user:

-   Update to the latest version then open Settings -> Customizations -> Build
    with Google Plugins (click on 'Customize' at the bottom of the page) ->
    Download the `Science` plugin

### Prerequisites

We use the `uv` package manager to handle dependencies. The first time you
trigger a Science Skill, the agent will ask for approval and install `uv`, and
then proceed to respond to your scientific query / task. We recommend restarting
Antigravity after this first time installation.

Some skills, such as AlphaGenome and OpenAlex, require an API key to function.
Others, such as ClinVar, benefit from an API key to unlock higher rate limits
but are still functional without one. The agent should prompt you to obtain the
API key and guide you through writing in the correct location. However, if you
would rather do this yourself, you can run a command like this in your terminal:
`echo "ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key" >> ~/.env`
