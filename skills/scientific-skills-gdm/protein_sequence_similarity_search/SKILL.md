name: protein-sequence-similarity-search
description: >
    Searches for homologous protein sequences using MMseqs2 (fast, default) or
    BLAST (comprehensive, fallback). Trigger this whenever the user provides a
    protein sequence or FASTA file and asks to find homologues, sequence
    matches, or wants to infer protein function based on sequence similarity,
    but not when the user wants to infer protein function based on structural
    similarity.
---

## Prerequisites

1.  **`uv`**: Read the `uv` skill and follow its Setup instructions to ensure
    `uv` is installed and on PATH.
2.  **User Notification**: If LICENSE_NOTIFICATION.txt does not already exist in
    this skill directory then (1) prominently notify the user to check the terms
    at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/sss/ncbiblast and
    https://colabfold.com, then (2) create the file recording the notification
    text and timestamp.
3.  **`.env` file**: Make sure the `.env` file exists in your home directory.
    Create one if it does not exist.
4.  **`USER_EMAIL`** (optional but recommended): Recommended by the EBI for
    BLAST job tracking, but the skill works without it. If the variable is
    missing from `.env`, do NOT ask the user to paste it into the chat (this
    would leak the value into the agent's context). Instead, give the user this
    command — **substituting `ENV_FILE` with the resolved literal path to the
    `.env` file**:

    ```bash
    printf "Enter contact email: " && read email && echo "USER_EMAIL=$email" >> "ENV_FILE" && echo "Saved."
    ```

    The scripts load credentials automatically via `dotenv`. **NEVER** read,
    print, or inspect the `.env` file or its variables (e.g. no `cat`, `grep`,
    `echo`, `printenv`, or `os.environ.get` on keys). Credentials must stay out
    of the agent's context.

## Goal

Take a user-provided amino acid sequence (or a path to a `.fasta` file), search
for sequence homologues using the fastest available method, generate a
Markdown-formatted table of the top hits, interpret key alignment metrics,
summarize the inferred protein functions, and save results locally for future
programmatic analysis.

## Core Rules

-   **Strict Validation**: For BLAST, only use database codes listed in the
    table below.
-   **No Hallucinations**: If a script throws an error or returns no hits,
    inform the user clearly. Do NOT invent sequence homologues.
-   **Do Not Parse Output Files**: Do not parse the JSON, a3m, or any other raw
    output files. Rely on the generated `.md` file for your summary. The JSON
    and other outputs are for subsequent tool use only.
-   **Always State the Method**: Every report must clearly state whether the
    search used the quick MMseqs2 (ColabFold API) or the slower EBI BLAST
    method.
-   **Notification**: If this skill is used, ensure this is mentioned in the
    output. Explicitly state that the corresponding program (MMSEQS2 or EBI
    BLAST) and Sequence Databases were used.

## Search Method Selection

Choose the search method based on the user's request:

If the **user says "quick search" or "fast search"**, **no specific method
requested / general homologue search**, of if you are unsure: Run MMseqs2 (fast,
default) using `mmseqs2_search.py`

If **MMseqs2 fails (exit code 2: RATELIMIT or API error)** or **User explicitly
requests "BLAST"** or **a specific BLAST database** (e.g. `uniprotkb_swissprot`,
`pdb`, `uniprotkb_human`): Run BLAST using `uniprot_blast.py`

## Instructions

1.  Identify the query from the user. It can be a raw sequence string (e.g.,
    "MKVLY...") or a path to a local file (e.g., "./data/sequence.fasta").

2.  **Determine the search method** using the list above.

### Path A: MMseqs2 Search (Default)

1.  **Generate File Names:** Generate descriptive output file names based on the
    input (e.g., `proteinA_mmseqs2.json` and `proteinA_mmseqs2.md`).
2.  Execute the MMseqs2 script:

    *   **Default:**

    ```
    uv run scripts/mmseqs2_search.py <SEQUENCE_OR_FILE> -o <generated-filename.md> -j <generated-filename.json>
    ```

    *   **With mgnify:**

    ```
    uv run scripts/mmseqs2_search.py <SEQUENCE_OR_FILE> -o <generated-filename.md> -j <generated-filename.json> --include-mgnify
    ```

3.  The script will query the ColabFold MMseqs2 API and poll for completion.
    This is typically fast (under 2 minutes).

4.  **If the script exits with code 2** (API failure, rate limit), automatically
    fall back to BLAST (Path B below). Inform the user: "MMseqs2 search failed,
    falling back to BLAST."

5.  **Read the Results:** Open and read the generated `.md` file.

### Path B: BLAST Search (Explicit or Fallback)

1.  **Database Selection & Validation:** Determine the most appropriate
    database(s) based on the user's prompt.
    *   Consult the **Available BLAST Databases** table below.
    *   If the user specifies a taxonomic group (e.g., "Find homologues in
        microbes"), select the corresponding `Database Code` (e.g.,
        `uniprotkb_bacteria`).
    *   If the user explicitly requests curated hits, use `uniprotkb_swissprot`.
    *   If no specific database is requested, do not specify `--databases`.
    *   **Validation:** Ensure the database code exactly matches an entry in the
        table. If the user requests a database not on the list, **do not
        proceed** and provide the allowed list.
2.  **Generate File Names:** (e.g., `proteinA_ebi_blast.json` and
    `proteinA_ebi_blast.md`).
3.  This API requires the user email address to be set in the USER_EMAIL
    environment variable for inclusion in request header.
4.  Execute the BLAST script:

    *   **Default (uniprotkb):**

    ```
    uv run scripts/uniprot_blast.py <SEQUENCE_OR_FILE> -o <generated-filename.md> -j <generated-filename.json>
    ```

    *   **Custom database:**

    ```
    uv run scripts/uniprot_blast.py <SEQUENCE_OR_FILE> -o <generated-filename.md> -j <generated-filename.json> --databases <db1,db2>
    ```

5.  The script will query the EBI BLAST API and poll the server. **Note:** This
    can take up to 15 minutes; wait patiently.

6.  **Read the Results:** Open and read the generated `.md` file.

### Common Steps (Both Methods)

1.  **Interpret the Metrics:** Summarize the top 3 to 5 sequence homologues.
    Assess match quality using:
    *   **Q-Cov (Query Coverage):** High percentages mean the match covers most
        of the query sequence.
    *   **E-value:** Lower E-values (e.g., `1e-50`) indicate extreme statistical
        significance.
    *   **Seq Identity:** Provides evolutionary context (highly conserved vs.
        distant homologue).
2.  **Perform Functional Analysis:**
    *   If the results table includes protein descriptions, analyze them
        directly: report specific protein names/functions of the top homologues
        and summarize the variety of functions, domains, or protein families
        found.
    *   If the results contain only UniProt accession IDs without descriptions
        (common with MMseqs2), look up the protein names and functions for the
        top 3–5 hits using the **uniprot-database** skill or other appropriate
        methods before summarizing.
3.  Inform the user of both newly created files (`.json` and `.md`) and their
    locations.
