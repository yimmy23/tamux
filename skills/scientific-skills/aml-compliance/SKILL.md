```python
THRESHOLDS = {"ctr": 10000, "structuring_lookback": 5000}
HIGH_RISK_COUNTRIES = {"IR", "KP", "SY", "CU", "MM"}

def screen_tx(tx):
    alerts = []
    if tx.amount >= THRESHOLDS["ctr"]:
        alerts.append("CTR required — cash transaction over $10k")
    if tx.country in HIGH_RISK_COUNTRIES:
        alerts.append("OFAC sanctioned jurisdiction — enhanced due diligence")
    if tx.is_pep:
        alerts.append("PEP flagged — enhanced monitoring")
