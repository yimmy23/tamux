  Terminal Agentic Multiplexer
```

# tamux

**Terminal Agentic Multiplexer** -- a terminal multiplexer built for the age of AI agents.

Official website: `https://tamux.app`

tamux combines tmux-like session management with first-class AI agent integration, structured safety infrastructure, and a modern React-based UI. The backend is written in Rust for performance and reliability; the frontend is a React/TypeScript application rendered inside an Electron shell.

---

## Overview

tamux is an agentic-first terminal multiplexer designed to serve as a unified command environment where humans and AI agents collaborate. Rather than bolting AI onto a traditional terminal, tamux treats autonomous agent execution as a core primitive alongside PTY management, session persistence, and workspace isolation.

The daemon runs independently of any UI client, ensuring that agent workflows, long-running processes, and background sessions survive disconnects and can be reattached from any client -- CLI, Electron, or a future web interface.

Key design principles:

- **Daemon-first architecture.** All session state lives in the daemon. The UI is a stateless renderer.
- **Safety by default.** Managed commands pass through sandbox isolation, AST validation, policy evaluation, and structured approval workflows before execution.
- **Observable AI.** The agent's reasoning traces, tool calls, and decisions are surfaced in dedicated UI planes rather than hidden behind a black box.
- **Multi-provider flexibility.** Connect to 16 LLM providers out of the box, or bring your own via a custom endpoint.

---

## Key Features

### Terminal Management

- **BSP (Binary Space Partition) layout engine** for splitting panes horizontally and vertically with automatic tiling.
- **Layout presets** and resizable panels via `react-resizable-panels`.
- **Directional focus navigation** between panes (left, right, up, down).
- **Workspaces** with independent surfaces (tabs), each containing its own pane tree.
- **Session persistence** -- restore window state, workspaces, surfaces, pane layouts, and scrollback on restart.
- **Multiple shell profiles** with per-profile working directory, environment variables, and theme overrides.
- **Terminal transcripts** automatically captured on pane close or clear, with configurable retention.

### Agent Integration

- **Multi-provider LLM chat panel** with streaming responses, token tracking, and conversation memory.
- **16 built-in providers** (see table below) plus a custom endpoint option.
- **Configurable system prompts** and agent personas.
- **Context compaction** -- automatic summarization when the conversation exceeds a configurable token budget, preserving recent messages while compressing history.
- **Bash tool** allowing the agent to execute shell commands within managed sessions.
- **Web search tool** integration (Firecrawl, Exa, Tavily).
- **Procedural skills ecosystem** -- the daemon can generate reusable SKILL.md documents from successful execution trajectories.
- **Semantic symbol search** powered by tree-sitter AST indexing.

### Infrastructure

- **Sandbox isolation** using Linux namespaces / macOS Seatbelt to constrain managed command execution to the workspace boundary.
- **Ephemeral network toggling** -- network access is granted per-command and revoked on termination.
- **Filesystem snapshots** via pluggable backends: tar (portable), ZFS (copy-on-write, immutable), or BTRFS.
- **WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) integrity** -- append-only telemetry ledgers with SHA-256 hash chains, verifiable at any time.
- **CRIU checkpoint/restore** -- freeze and restore process state (CPU registers, memory, file descriptors) for instant crash reversal.
- **Credential scrubbing** -- automatic redaction of AWS keys, GitHub tokens, Bearer tokens, private keys, and other sensitive patterns from terminal output and logs.

### Policy Engine

- **Risk-pattern matching** with built-in rules for destructive operations (`rm -rf /`, `git push --force`, `terraform destroy`, `curl | bash`, disk-level mutations, service lifecycle changes).
- **Structured approval payloads** including the command, agent rationale, risk level, blast radius, and scope.
- **Three-option approval flow**: Allow Once, Allow For Session, Deny.
- **Cerbos integration** for external Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policy evaluation.
- **PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks** on the daemon event bus.

### Mission Control

- **Operational event tracking** -- command execution duration, exit codes, payloads in replayable JSONL.
- **Cognitive event tracking** -- agent reasoning traces, retrieved memory embeddings, compiled prompts.
- **Contextual telemetry** -- CPU, memory, and system health correlated with agent actions.
- **Approval workflows** rendered as structured interceptor modals rather than raw Y/N prompts.
- **Context snapshots** capturing the full workspace/session state before managed command batches.
- **Shared cursor model** -- visual distinction between human input, agent-managed execution, approval-pending, and idle states.

### MCP Server

- **tamux-mcp** exposes the daemon as a Model Context Protocol server over JSON-RPC stdio transport.
- Register it with Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client to give external agents access to terminal sessions, managed execution, snapshot management, and history search.

### Chat Gateway

- **tamux-gateway** bridges Slack, Discord, and Telegram to the daemon.
- Incoming messages matching a command prefix are translated into managed command requests.
- Daemon responses are streamed back to the originating chat channel.
- Per-chat session stores maintain conversation context across messages.

### UI Features

- **Command palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P) with fuzzy search across all actions and keybindings.
- **In-terminal search** with match highlighting and navigation.
- **Session vault** for browsing, searching, and replaying historical transcripts.
- **Snippet picker** for storing and inserting reusable text fragments.
- **Command log** with execution history, exit codes, and duration tracking.
- **System monitor** panel showing real-time CPU, memory, and process telemetry.
- **Execution canvas** -- a React Flow-based node graph for visualizing agent tool-call chains as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- **Reasoning stream** -- a dedicated panel parsing and rendering the agent's inner monologue and scratchpad.
- **Time-travel slider** -- browse and restore filesystem/process snapshots along a visual timeline.
- **Agent approval overlay** -- structured security interceptor with blast-radius visualization.
- **Notification system** supporting OSC 9, OSC 99, and OSC 777 protocols.
- **Theming** with built-in themes (Catppuccin Mocha default) and full custom color overrides.

## Documentation

- [Building CDUI Components And Views With YAML](docs/cdui-yaml-views.md)
- [Creating Your Own tamux Plugin](docs/plugin-development.md)

Runtime-installed plugins are now supported through `tamux install plugin <npm-package-or-local-path>`.

External npm plugins should declare a `tamuxPlugin` field in their `package.json` that points to a self-contained browser script entry file. The legacy `amuxPlugin` field is still accepted for compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75+ (2021 edition) with `cargo` -- https://rustup.rs
- **Node.js** 18+ with `npm` -- https://nodejs.org
- **Electron** 33+ (installed automatically via npm)

Optional system dependencies:

- `criu` binary for checkpoint/restore (Linux only, requires root privileges)
- ZFS or BTRFS filesystem for copy-on-write snapshots
- Cerbos PDP for external policy evaluation

### Build

```bash
# Build all Rust crates (daemon, CLI, gateway, MCP server)
cargo build --release

# Install frontend dependencies and start the development server
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build Components

Build the repository in slices depending on what you are changing:

```bash
# Rust workspace only
cargo build --release

# Individual Rust components
cargo build --release -p tamux-daemon
cargo build --release -p tamux-cli
cargo build --release -p tamux-gateway
cargo build --release -p tamux-mcp
cargo build --release -p tamux-protocol

# Frontend web bundle
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Electron desktop package
cd frontend
npm run build:electron
```

Recommended component-level workflow:

- Backend-only changes: run `cargo build --release` or the specific `-p` crate you changed.
- Frontend UI/component changes: run `cd frontend && npm run build`.
- Electron bridge or preload changes: run `cd frontend && npm run build` and then `cd frontend && npm run dev:electron`.
- End-to-end desktop packaging changes: run `cd frontend && npm run build:electron`.

### Run

```bash
# Start the daemon (required for all clients)
cargo run --release --bin tamux-daemon

# In another terminal, start the Electron app
cd frontend
npm run dev:electron

# Or use the CLI directly
cargo run --release --bin tamux -- list
cargo run --release --bin tamux -- new --shell bash
cargo run --release --bin tamux -- attach <session-id>
cargo run --release --bin tamux -- kill <session-id>
cargo run --release --bin tamux -- ping
```

### Electron Production Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build:electron
```

This produces platform packages in `frontend/release/`:
- **Linux:** AppImage and .deb
- **Windows:** Portable executable and NSIS installer

### Plugin Development Build Notes

Pinned guides:

- [Building CDUI Components And Views With YAML](docs/cdui-yaml-views.md)
- [Creating Your Own tamux Plugin](docs/plugin-development.md)

Frontend plugins are currently registered inside the React/Electron frontend and can contribute:

- React components via the component registry
- commands via the command registry
- YAML views persisted under `views/plugins/`

For packaged runtime plugins installed from npm or a local package directory:

- install with `tamux install plugin <npm-package-or-local-path>`
- the package should declare `tamuxPlugin.entry` in `package.json` (legacy `amuxPlugin.entry` is also accepted)
- the entry must be a self-contained browser script that registers itself through `window.TamuxApi.registerPlugin(...)` or `window.AmuxApi.registerPlugin(...)`
- Electron preload loads installed plugin scripts from `~/.tamux/plugins/registry.json` during app startup

The core plugin entry points live in:

- `frontend/src/plugins/PluginManager.ts`
- `frontend/src/plugins/globalAPI.ts`

When building a plugin-backed feature:

- UI-only plugin work still validates through `cd frontend && npm run build`.
- If the plugin depends on filesystem, PATH discovery, or system processes, implement the bridge in `frontend/electron/preload.cjs` and `frontend/electron/main.cjs`, then validate with `cd frontend && npm run dev:electron`.
- Keep plugin runtime modules isolated from daemon code unless the feature truly requires a new daemon capability.

The coding-agents feature follows this model: a frontend plugin-backed UI, an Electron discovery bridge for PATH probing, and launch through the existing terminal pane/session path.

Built-in runtime profiles now include richer support for:

- `Hermes Agent`: interactive CLI, one-shot task mode, gateway mode, config detection under `~/.hermes`, and MCP-oriented setup hints.
- `pi.dev`: interactive CLI, one-shot print mode, RPC mode, and config/session detection under `~/.pi/agent`.
- `OpenClaw`: direct agent mode, gateway runtime mode, config detection under `~/.openclaw`, and local gateway reachability checks for `127.0.0.1:18789`.

The assistant panel now also includes an `AI Training` surface with first-class launch and health support for:

- `Prime Intellect Verifiers`: lab setup, environment init, evaluation run, and eval TUI workflows.
- `AutoResearch`: workspace-aware prepare and train flows for the Karpathy repo workflow.
- `AutoRL`: workspace-aware virtualenv setup and evaluator runs for the Simverse-backed scaffold.

### MCP Server Registration

Register `tamux-mcp` with Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tamux": {
      "command": "tamux-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Configuration

### Config File Locations

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/tamux/config.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/tamux/config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\tamux\config.json` |

Data directory: `~/.tamux/` on Unix, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tamux\` on Windows. Existing `amux` directories are migrated forward when possible.

### Settings Panel

The built-in Settings panel (Ctrl+,) exposes all configuration options organized into sections:

**Appearance** -- font family, font size, theme selection, opacity, line height, padding, custom terminal colors (background, foreground, cursor, selection).

**Cursor** -- style (bar, block, underline), blink toggle, blink interval in milliseconds.

**Terminal** -- default shell and arguments, scrollback lines (default 10,000), bell sound, visual bell, bracketed paste.

**Behavior** -- session restore on startup, confirm on close, auto-copy on select, Ctrl+click URL opening, auto-save interval, transcript capture on close/clear, command log and transcript retention periods.

**Infrastructure** -- sandbox enabled/disabled, sandbox network access, snapshot backend (tar, zfs, btrfs), WORM integrity toggle, Cerbos PDP endpoint.

**Agent** -- active provider, per-provider API keys and model selection, system prompt, agent name, streaming toggle, conversation memory, context compaction (auto-compact threshold, token budget, messages to keep), bash tool toggle and timeout, web search tool provider and API keys.

**Keybindings** -- rebind any action to a custom key combination, reset all to defaults.

### IPC Protocol

The daemon and all clients communicate via length-prefixed bincode frames over Unix domain sockets (Linux/macOS) or localhost TCP on port 17563 (Windows). The protocol is defined in `amux-protocol` and consists of two enums:

- `ClientMessage` -- requests from any client to the daemon (spawn, attach, input, execute managed command, resolve approval, list sessions, search history, etc.)
- `DaemonMessage` -- responses and events from the daemon to clients (output, command lifecycle, approval required, search results, snapshots, errors, etc.)
